Apple Macs are the best computers for South African businesses and they’re easy to integrate into your organization. They offer fantastic performance and compatibility with all the applications your employees use for work, which is why many South African companies are making the switch to Apple Macs. We find out more about the benefits of moving your company onto Apple Macs, below. One of the concerns many businesses have is that if they equip their teams with Macs, they will not be able to run all of the programs they currently use. This couldn’t be further from the truth, as Apple Macs can run macOS or Windows – and support all the programs you currently use on either of these platforms. For example: if you currently use Microsoft Excel, you can either continue using Excel on your Mac or switch to Numbers. You can also use an extensive range of platform-agnostic applications, including the Adobe Creative Cloud, Slack, Zoom, and much more. Your employees will therefore have everything they need to perform their current tasks – but they will now be on a lightning-fast Apple Mac. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-444082 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/In-article-Image-iStore-May-2022.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/In-article-Image-iStore-May-2022.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/In-article-Image-iStore-May-2022-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/In-article-Image-iStore-May-2022-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Apple has elevated its computers and laptops to the highest level thanks to its ground-breaking M1 chip, making its devices the fastest and longest-lasting in their classes.
