The most expensive electric bicycle in South Africa is the 2022 Bianchi E-Suv Rally Xtr Dual Suspension E-Bike, boasting a full carbon body and a Shimano EP8 motor. Able to reach speeds of up to 25 km/h on rough terrain, the electric bicycle — and motor — is available from Cycle Lab for R230,000 and is designed to provide the natural feel of riding a regular mountain bike. According to Felt Racing, experienced trail mountain bike riders can reach speeds of up to 24 km/h. Therefore, the Bianchi E-Suv Rally E-Bike can put even the most experienced trail mountain bike riders to shame. However, according to Bianchi, it is “less about competition and more about exploration and enjoyment”. In addition to the 25km/h top speed, the e-bike’s motor produces 85 Nm of torque, and its 720 Wh battery promises a lifespan long enough to “unlock those far-flung places”. Other key features of the Bianchi E-Suv Rally E-Bike include a Fox 38 Float Fork, Spanninga integrated front lights, the Shimano Steps E-8000 bike system, and Kenda Hellkat and Regolith tyres. Shimano says the Steps E-8000 bike system is a complementary suite of components designed to offer intuitive trail support and can be linked to a smartphone, tablet, or computer to wirelessly programme rider preferences. These components include the motor and drive units, shifters, rear derailleur, crankset, chain, and four-piston brakes. The Spanninga lights are integrated with the front fender and produce 1,100 lumens with a 200m beam. The Bianchi E-Suv Rally has asymmetrical tyre sizes, measuring 29-inches (73.7cm) at the front and 27.5-inches (70cm) at the rear. Bianchi’s E-Suv E-bike family includes two other variants — the Adventure and Racer — and the Rally falls between these two models in terms of specs and price. Bianchi says the Rally “can take on anything and go all night” with its large battery and powerful lights.
