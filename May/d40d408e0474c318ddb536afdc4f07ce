This enhances Honor’s reputation for building fantastic vlogging smartphones by offering dual video recording that allows you to shoot from front and rear cameras simultaneously. Therefore, you can capture creative video content with ease – record special family moments from both perspectives or vlog a cooking demonstration. Additionally, the Honor X8 supports enhanced 1080p video recording that allows you to capture your favourite memories, which you can enjoy for years to come. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-443134" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ZEC-7-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ZEC-7-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ZEC-7-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ZEC-7-711x533.jpg 711w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ZEC-7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ZEC-7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ZEC-7-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ZEC-7-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Honor X8 also houses a 4,000mAh battery with 22.5W Honor SuperCharge that guarantees a long-lasting charge for you to enjoy throughout the day.
