The Hisense South Africa Industrial Park has received its first order from the European market in a landmark achievement for the local facility. The order was from the UK and was for a batch of BCD-272 refrigerators, which have already been shipped. This is a celebratory moment for Hisense South Africa because it highlights the tremendous growth its Industrial Park facility has achieved since it was built in 2013. It also proves that this South African manufacturing facility is now one of Hisense’s global bases from which the company can serve a broader market. Additionally, the export deal with the UK is evidence that Hisense products are of the highest quality – as European quality control and approval is known to be extremely strict. Hisense entered the South African market in 1996 as its first major step towards developing a global presence. Over the 26 years that have followed, its products have become extremely popular across the country. It was therefore no surprise that in March 2013, Hisense Group and the China Africa Development (CAD) Fund signed a joint investment cooperation agreement to build the Hisense South Africa Industrial Park. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-444208" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hisense-Industrial-Park2.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hisense-Industrial-Park2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hisense-Industrial-Park2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hisense-Industrial-Park2-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This facility, which spans over 100,000 square metres, has since grown from having a few initial employees to now employing nearly 1,000 people and is estimated to have created nearly 5,000 jobs indirectly. It has also expanded its operations from manufacturing a single product category of TVs to many other categories – including refrigerators and smartphones. The factory is now capable of producing 10 million market-leading TV sets and 550,000 refrigerators per year, which until its recent order from the UK, had been sold in South Africa and neighbouring African countries. The Hisense South Africa Industrial Park is mutually beneficial to both Hisense and the people of South Africa, as Hisense extends its global reach while South Africa benefits from job creation and the strengthening of its manufacturing industry.
