Vodacom has announced another round of price increases, this time on its Red Flexi and mobile broadband price plans. The price increases will take effect from 1 June 2022. Red Flexi subscribers will receive an additional R5 to R30 airtime, depending on the size of the package, but they will also have to pay more. Therefore, the mobile network operator’s Red Flexi subscribers will have to decide whether to accept the increase or move to a lower package. “As we move forward with 2022 and continue to provide a quality service, we are updating our Flexi price plans to ensure that our customers get the best airtime value possible,” Vodacom said on the update page. Vodacom increased mobile contract prices on 1 April 2022, with the mobile network operator saying it capped the increases at 5.3% and that the increases would only apply to subscription fees. “The Covid–19 landscape has led to an increased digital demand as we take much of our personal and professional lives online,” Vodacom said. “As a result, we’ve been working hard behind the scenes to continue to provide you with a quality service.” Notably, Vodacom did not announce any changes to its Red Flexi or mobile broadband plans at the time. Instead, it increased prices for its Legacy Smart, Legacy Red, New Red, and Red for Business plans. A summary of the changes to Vodacom’s Red Flexi plans, including VAT, is provided in the table below. Vodacom mobile broadband postpaid and top-up subscribers also received a notice that their fees would increase. “While cost increases are unavoidable across all industries, we are committed to keeping them as low as possible,” the company said. “From 1 June 2022, all mobile broadband plans will increase by only 3%.” The table below summarises Vodacom’s mobile broadband plans price increases.
