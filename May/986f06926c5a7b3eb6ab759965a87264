Walt Disney has revealed more details about the content and features available on its video streaming service Disney+ when it launches in South Africa on 18 May 2022. During a media showcase on Thursday, Walt Disney Company Africa senior vice president and general manager Christine Service shed light on some of the service’s plans for South Africa. Service said that the Disney+ library in South Africa would boast over 1,000 movies, 1,500 library series, and more than 200 original series, movies, and specials at launch. Service said that Walt Disney had high hopes for the South African market, where Walt Disney has been active for over 50 years. To illustrate its local influence, Service pointed out that Disney accounts for 11 of the top 20 grossing movies of all time at the South African box office. “I am confident that Disney+ will become a favourite streaming service in South Africa,” Service said. Service said that Disney+ aims to produce 60 local productions across the European, Middle Eastern, and African markets. Disney+ in South Africa will include movies and shows from Walt Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic properties. It will also have the Star content hub. Star is Disney’s hub for movies and shows aimed at adults. It features titles from FX, Searchlight Pictures, Disney TV studios, and 20th Century Studios (formerly 20th Century Fox). The video streaming serice will allow users to browse the catalogue on its mobile app before signing up. Below are some of the titles that are confirmed to be coming to Disney+ in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-443362"
