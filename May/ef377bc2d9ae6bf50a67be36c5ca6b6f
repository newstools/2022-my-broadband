This year, the most popular movie in South Africa — viewed in Ster-Kinekor theatres — is Spider-Man: No Way Home, while the top films on Netflix and Showmax are Senior Year and Till Death, respectively. The top ten list for Ster-Kinekor includes titles such as The Batman, Uncharted, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Encanto, The Lost City, and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore. MyBroadband reached out to Ster-Kinekor and Nu Metro to find out which movies were most popular at each from 1 January to mid-May this year. Nu Metro had not answered our query by the time of publication. Cinemas in South Africa have been fighting an uphill battle recently as they try to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns. International streaming platforms could also pose a threat to the cinema business in South Africa. However, cinema operators maintain they still have plenty to offer South Africans. Ster-Kinekor believes that cinema is “central to popular culture” and is here to stay. Nu Metro is of a similar belief. Its operational executive, Andries Basson, previously told MyBroadband that streaming services could not replace cinema. “Cinemas deliver a multi-dimensional entertainment experience which can’t be duplicated via other platforms,” he said. The most-popular movies screened at Ster-Kinekor this year are described briefly below. Peter Parker goes to Doctor Strange for help as he wants to make people forget about Spiderman’s identity. However, the spell doesn’t go to plan, and several unwanted guests enter their world. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-445320" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spider-Man-No-Way-Home.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spider-Man-No-Way-Home.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spider-Man-No-Way-Home-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spider-Man-No-Way-Home-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Batman ventures into Gotham City’s underworld to stop the Riddler’s ongoing killing spree.
