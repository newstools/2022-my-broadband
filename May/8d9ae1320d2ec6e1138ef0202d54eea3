There are three main priority modes to choose from: UrbanX is able to offer these modes because the Command your Connection Discord bot integrates directly into the UrbanX core network and enables end-to-end prioritisation of your traffic. The tool therefore offers superior optimisation and is easier to use than traditional router-based shaping.  UrbanX already stands out from the crowd with this offer – and it has big plans to expand this service in the future. This includes the ability to use the bot to request an upgrade to your Internet package, retrieve your billing information, and update your personal details. UrbanX is also looking to extend its Command your Connection bot to WhatsApp, which will give even more subscribers access to the tool’s amazing capabilities. UrbanX is South Africa’s first dedicated gaming ISP, and offers lightning-fast and stable fibre connections for superior online gameplay. It has entered into direct peering agreements and partnerships with popular games like League of Legends, Valorant, Fortnite, Rocket League, Dota 2, and Call of Duty: Warzone to give you the best ping possible. It also offers fast download and upload speeds so that you can download your favourite games and stream your favourite shows seamlessly. Join the UrbanX revolution today.
