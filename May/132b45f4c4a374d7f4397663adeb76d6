Certifications are not just about acquiring new designations, however; they also offer other benefits such as greater in-depth skills, job satisfaction, and productivity. A study by Pearson VUE found that 90% of technical professionals say certifications build confidence, while 76% say that since they have been certified, they have been more satisfied in their jobs. Additionally, IDC research shows that trained and certified teams who are responsible for core IT activities are almost 20% more productive than those with less training. Even more exciting is the fact that Microsoft-certified professionals perform 26% better across all roles than uncertified IT professionals with the same responsibilities. MIE is focused on upskilling your employees, and has therefore created a comprehensive guide that will help you plan your skilling categories under the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program. This guide includes the qualifying criteria, the intermediate and advanced certifications that must be achieved to meet these criteria, and the maximum points that can be achieved for each solution area.
