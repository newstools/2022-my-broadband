Bitcoin slumped for the seventh time in eight days, raising concern that the slide risks pushing the largest cryptocurrency out of the range it has traded within much of the year. Cryptocurrencies have been weighed down by the overall risk aversion that has swept though global markets as central banks battle inflation while trying to temper the stimulus added during the Covid pandemic. Bitcoin is down more than 20% so far this year. “If risk sentiment continues plummeting, the chicken bones on the technical charts suggest Bitcoin could be on its way to $28,000 and then $20,000,” Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific, said in an email. “HODL on for dear life.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-443600" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bear-Grip-800x449.jpg" alt="Bear Grip" width="639" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bear-Grip-800x449.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bear-Grip-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bear-Grip-768x431.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bear-Grip.jpg 814w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Bitcoin fell about 1% to $36,077 as of 5 p.m. Eastern time Friday. It touched the lowest level since February and closed down around 6.3% since last Friday. The digital asset has been meandering between roughly $33,000 and the $48,000 it came into the year. It last traded below $32,000 in July. Ether, Avalanche and Solana also declined this week. About $475 million in long Bitcoin positions were liquidated over a 24-hours period, according to data from Coinglass. Bitcoin fell around 8% on Thursday, the biggest one-day drop since January. Bitcoin “is down by nearly 10%, breaking its support price, and there are chances that it may break below the current level,” said Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex, an algorithmic-based crypto investment platform. “BTC’s support now lies at $32,000.” Bitcoin has been largely trading in tandem with tech stocks — both the coin and the tech-centric Nasdaq 100 hit all-time highs in November and have been on a volatile downward path since. The Nasdaq 100 fell for a fifth consecutive week. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-443598" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Moving-in-the-same-direction-800x449.jpg" alt="Moving in the same direction" width="639" height="359" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Moving-in-the-same-direction-800x449.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Moving-in-the-same-direction-600x337.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Moving-in-the-same-direction-768x431.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Moving-in-the-same-direction.jpg 814w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The 90-day correlation coefficient of Bitcoin and the tech gauge now stands above 0.67, the highest such reading in Bloomberg data going back to 2010. A coefficient of 1 means the assets are moving in lockstep, while minus-1 would show they’re moving in opposite directions. David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase Global Inc., has been arguing that there are plenty of headwinds facing crypto — and other markets — this year, including more hawkish central-bank policies, as well as uncertainty over the path of global economies. Duong attended the Milken Institute conference this past week, saying that a key takeaway was that many thought — despite turmoil seen in markets so far this year — that “there is still a good chance for further downside correction across risk assets.”
