The advent of the fourth industrial revolution – which brought about a rise in IoT, cloud computing, and advanced analytics – has forced businesses to prioritise digital transformation. This has led to increased vulnerabilities in operational technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) networks, which cannot be paused without significantly affecting production and are fundamental to business operations. Therefore, businesses need to shift their focus from just IT security to a full cybersecurity solution that offers services such as unidirectional security gateways. Unidirectional security gateways protect the transfer of your mission-critical data in real-time from ICS networks to corporate business systems. They are considered to be one of the most effective forms of defence against cyberattacks and protect your business in the following ways: For each of these scenarios, a unidirectional gateway is used to transfer data to an external replica database on the IT network, where it can be accessed by the OT vendor. This allows data to be transferred safely and across all environments. Through its turnkey product, NetWall USG, OPSWAT helps govern and secure the transfer of files and the communication between devices across networks – providing real-time unidirectional access to OT systems and industrial data. OPSWAT NetWall USG stands out from the competition thanks to its proprietary technologies that deliver enhanced performance and scalability. This includes: These features ensure that your business remains operational and secure at all times. Altron Arrow is a distributor and supporter of OPSWAT technologies and solutions in South Africa.
