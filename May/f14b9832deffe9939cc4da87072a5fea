He is passionate about transforming how people and goods move across cities and is focused on building Uber into the biggest earnings platform in Africa.

In this episode of What’s Next, Khaole discusses the latest developments at Uber Sub-Saharan Africa. He talks about Uber’s latest initiatives, including its exciting new on-demand delivery solution – Uber Connect Car. Khaole also unpacks how Uber has changed the services it provides over the past year and how the market has reacted to these changes.
