South Africans in the market for a laptop that offers the fastest processors and best graphics cards available in a portable form factor have some excellent options to choose from. While these machines are more expensive than most laptops on the market, you’ll be guaranteed a high-performance device that can tackle any task you throw at it with ease. The MacBook M1 Pro and Max chipsets sold in South Africa feature 16-core and 32-core graphics processors. Both offer up to 14 hours of battery life and a 10-core CPU which provides fast and reliable performance. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio has a maximum processing speed of up to 4.8 GHz and features a 14-inch touchscreen display. The convertible display provides tablet functionality which can be useful for graphic editors and designers. For those looking to buy an ideal allrounder, the MSI Creator M16 or Dell XPS 17 are notable options. Both devices feature an 11th-Gen Core i7 processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU (with the MSI sporting the Ti variant), and each will run any task comfortably. Either laptop is suited to programming, multimedia, business, and even gaming. Gaming enthusiasts in the market for a high-performance laptop should consider the specifications of the graphics card, the central processing unit (CPU), and the amount of RAM. The display’s refresh rate is also important, particularly when the device contains a high-end GPU. The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 offers a 12th-Gen Core i7 CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card, 24GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD, and a 165Hz display refresh rate. This makes it capable of running any modern game at a consistent 60 frames per second and above. The prices and specifications of these laptops are listed below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-443592" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Acer-Predator-Helios-500.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Acer-Predator-Helios-500.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Acer-Predator-Helios-500-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Acer-Predator-Helios-500-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-443556" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/macbook-pro-16-inch-01-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/macbook-pro-16-inch-01.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/macbook-pro-16-inch-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/macbook-pro-16-inch-01-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-443556" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/macbook-pro-16-inch-01-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/macbook-pro-16-inch-01.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/macbook-pro-16-inch-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/macbook-pro-16-inch-01-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-443558" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dell-XPS-17-01-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dell-XPS-17-01.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dell-XPS-17-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dell-XPS-17-01-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-443560" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Surface-Studio-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Surface-Studio.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Surface-Studio-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Surface-Studio-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-443562" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-443566" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MSI-Creator-m16-0-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MSI-Creator-m16-0.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MSI-Creator-m16-0-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MSI-Creator-m16-0-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
