SpaceX employees are offering to sell shares via a private placement that would value Elon Musk’s launch and satellite company at around $125 billion (R2.01 trillion), according to people familiar with the matter. The shares are being offered in a so-called employee tender at $70 each, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. That compares with a split-adjusted $56-a-share during a sale in October at a valuation of about $100 billion. It’s unclear whether Musk is selling stock as part of the employee tender, the people said. The size of the offering couldn’t immediately be determined. SpaceX didn’t respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. The New York Post reported the share placement plan earlier. Musk has been seeking a variety of funding sources to complete his agreement to purchase Twitter Inc. On Monday he suggested the deal for the social media platform might be completed at a lower price, days after he questioned Twitter’s ability to estimate how many accounts are spam or fake.
