Apple will likely stop selling the iPhone 11 following the launch of the iPhone 14 later this year, iDropNews has reported. The change would continue its trend of dropping older smartphones from its line-up after a new flagship launch. Most recently, Apple stopped making the iPhone XR, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max after the launch of the iPhone 13 in September 2021. However, there seems to be more to the decision this time around, with the report stating that Apple regards the iPhone 11 as a direct competitor to its recently-launched iPhone SE 5G. Citing sources, iDropNews reported the 2019 flagship has been selling more than average since the iPhone SE 5G’s launch. Apple has been criticised for using the 2014 design of the iPhone 8 for the iPhone SE 5G. However, the iPhone SE 5G does have a top-notch chip in the A15 Bionic, some improvements in photographic capabilities, and 5G connectivity. In contrast, the iPhone 11 offers a premium design, with no bottom bezel and a smaller notch at the top, a bigger and more advanced camera system, and Face ID biometric authentication. In South Africa, the entry-level 64GB iPhone SE 5G costs R9,799 from the iStore, while the iPhone 11 with the same storage costs R11,799. The country’s biggest mobile operator Vodacom offers the iPhone 11 64GB for R669 per month, and iPhone SE 5G on the same Red 1GB 100-minute contract for R599. The good news for those looking for a deal on one of Apple’s other previous flagships is that these could see price drops once the iPhone 14 is launched. According toiDropNews, 2020’s iPhone 12 price will drop to $599 in the US, while the iPhone 12 Mini could stick around in limited stock for $499. For reference, the iPhone SE 5G costs $429 in the US. Should price reductions be similar in South Africa, the iPhone 12 could become the preferred “affordable” Apple smartphone.
