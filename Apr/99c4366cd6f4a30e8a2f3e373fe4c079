Eskom chief generation officer Phillip Dukashe said that, in the best-case scenario, they could suspend load-shedding on Friday, 22 April 2022. This is the first time in years the power utility has avoided giving an estimated time by which load-shedding would end. Dukashe announced Eskom’s best-case scenario during a media briefing held by Eskom on Tuesday, 19 April 2022. The power utility implemented Stage 2 load-shedding on Sunday, 17 April 2022, following the loss of four generation units at the Matla, Tutuka, Duvha, and Arnot power stations. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha then announced it would be pushed to Stage 4 on Tuesday morning after two more generation units at Majuba and Tutuka tripped. Current outages total 20,446MW, of which 5,124MW is due to planned maintenance. André de Ruyter, Eskom’s CEO, acknowledged that the outages were “unacceptably high” but added that Stage 4 load-shedding had to be implemented at short notice to shed 4,000MW of demand to prevent a total blackout. According to de Ruyter, high demand over the weekend due to colder weather exacerbated the country’s power situation. The increased demand meant that Eskom could not take certain units offline for scheduled maintenance. As a result, some of the units tripped. Dukashe explained that Friday, Saturday, and Sunday’s peak demand was 700MW, 1,687MW, and 1,200MW higher than usual, respectively. He said they should know by Thursday or Friday when Eskom can suspend load-shedding.
