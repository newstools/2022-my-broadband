Samsung and its retail partners are offering an attractive R10,000 guaranteed trade-in value for various Apple, Huawei, and Samsung flagship smartphones that launched as far back as 2017. Let’s get something out of the way — I don’t believe you need to upgrade your smartphone every year or two. I probably would have stuck it out with a smartphone for four or five years if it weren’t for battery degradation and short software support periods. But Samsung South Africa changed my mind this year after its director of integrated mobility, Justin Hume, revealed a R10,000 guaranteed trade-in promotion on several smartphone models when buying the Galaxy S22. Their only requirement is that the phone needs to turn on and remain powered without being plugged in, and it must not be blacklisted. Your trade-in device can be severely damaged, and you will still get the full R10,000. That includes having a cracked screen, broken camera, dented body, and other damage. This was music to my ears, as I recently had a mishap with my beloved Galaxy S20. I had been the owner of this compact powerhouse for about a year by the 2020 December holidays. That was when it somehow picked up a large crack in the left bottom corner of its display. An unfortunate fall only days later put another hole in the display and extended the existing cracks over the entire bottom half of the screen. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-439064" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220316_111540-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220316_111540-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220316_111540-533x400.jpg 533w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220316_111540-711x533.jpg 711w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220316_111540-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220316_111540-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220316_111540-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20220316_111540-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While the S20 still performed very well and met my daily needs with no issue, the cracks in the display quickly became obtrusive. As the phone was well outside of its warranty, I went online in the hopes of finding a cheap solution for a fix. I discovered plenty of DIY kits for replacing the front glass — the only part of the screen that was damaged. These sold for between R900 and R1,500, but I soon learnt that employing them required sophisticated tools and delicate handiwork. With great hesitation, I proceeded to various cellphone repair shops. To the horror of my wallet, they could only replace the entire screen, including the LCD, which would cost no less than R5,000. I could probably only get R10,000 for the phone after repairing the screen if I wanted to sell it. So I let it be — until Samsung’s Galaxy S22 launch and trade-in offer came along. To use the offer, you first need to buy a Galaxy S22 smartphone or opt for trade-in while buying from Samsung’s online store. As the latter could leave me without a phone if the collection courier happened to be faster than the delivery of my new device, I opted for the former. I chose the standard Galaxy S22 and bought it directly from Samsung South Africa’s online store. This allowed me to add an accessory at a R2,000 discount, effectively bringing the phone’s price down to R16,999. Once I had my stunning new green Galaxy S22, I proceeded with the trade-in. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-439066" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Galaxy-S22-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Galaxy-S22-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Galaxy-S22--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Galaxy-S22--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Using the post-sale R10,000 trade-in link, I entered details of my old device, including its damaged screen and IMEI, before being offered R10,000. I then had to enter the IMEI of the Galaxy S22, provide my bank account number for the R10,000 payment, and an address for collection. After submitting my details, I promptly received an email from Regener8, Samsung’s trade-in facilitator, confirming my trade-in application. They asked for a preferred date and courier address to collect my trade-in device. After responding, they provided a tracking number and instructions to backup my files and factory reset the phone. The following pictures show that I put my cracked Galaxy S20 back in its original packaging, but this is not required. The courier arrived as scheduled around lunchtime on Thursday, 17 March 2022, and carried my old S20 off to the assessment facility. A few hours later, Regener8 confirmed they received the Galaxy S20 and were assessing it. On Saturday, 19 March 2022, the company confirmed my device powered on as required, and I qualified for the R10,000. They then asked that I confirm my banking details and said that payment would be made on 28 March 2022. The money was paid two days late, after I had logged a query, and Samsung apologised for the delay due to unprecedented demand for the offer. I also qualified for free Galaxy Buds Live worth R2,000, which was delivered on 29 March 2022. If trade-in offers like these become a common occurrence at Samsung, they won’t be losing this customer anytime soon.
