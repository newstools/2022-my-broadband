World football governing association FIFA has launched an online video streaming service called FIFA+. The service’s content includes live domestic league games from around the world, an archive of previously-broadcast international football matches, and original productions. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said FIFA+ represented the “next step” in the association’s vision to make football “truly global and inclusive” and expand and develop the sport globally. “This project represents a cultural shift in the way different types of football fans want to connect with and explore the global game and has been a fundamental part of my Vision 2020-2023.” “It will accelerate the democratisation of football, and we are delighted to share it with fans.” FIFA said it would be streaming 40,000 live men’s and women’s football games annually on FIFA+ by year-end. That will include matches from 100 member associations across all six confederations. The archive section launched with more than 2,500 videos dating back to the 1950s, with more to be added throughout the year. That will include every FIFA World Cup and FIFA Women’s World Cup match recorded on camera — more than 2,000 hours of footage. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-441158 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FIFA--800x452.png" alt="" width="800" height="452" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FIFA--800x452.png 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FIFA--600x339.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FIFA--768x434.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FIFA--1536x868.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FIFA--2048x1158.png 2048w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FIFA--1200x678.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In addition to videos, FIFA+ boasts a match centre with a news feed and data from 400 men’s and 65 women’s competitions.
