A Netherlands resident has embedded a chip in his hand that lets him make contactless payments, BBC News reported. Patrick Paumen, aged 37, has been able to make such payments using the chip he implanted in his hand since 2019. Contactless payment methods use near-field communication (NFC) to transact — the same technology used by bank cards, smartphones and smartwatches capable of making contactless payments. All Paumen must do to make a payment is wave his hand over a contactless payment terminal. The chip illuminates when it is in range of a contactless point of sale. He explained that the procedure to implant the chip felt similar to someone pinching his hand. While there is concern over whether a person can be tracked through such chips, Paumen is not concerned. He explained that, much like the radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips used to identify pets when they are lost, anyone wishing to identify him would need to scan his hand. Paumen regards himself as a “biohacker” and has 32 implants, including magnets and chips to unlock NFC-compatible doors. To implant chips like the one Paumen has in his hand, they first need to be encapsulated in a bioplastic. In 2019, Tesla owner Amie DD embedded the chip from her car’s keycard in her arm. DD had to dissolve the keycard in acetone and package it in a bioplastic before it could be implanted, and she said that it was only effective within one inch of her console due to swelling at the implant site.
