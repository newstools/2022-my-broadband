Electric vehicles (EVs) are known for offering excellent acceleration performance, and South Africans have several high-performance EVs from which to choose. The most impressive high-performance electric vehicle in South Africa is the Porsche Taycan Turbo S, with a 0 to 100km/h time of 2.8 seconds. Its electric motors produce 560kW of power and 1,050Nm of torque, and its battery can carry the vehicle 390–416km on a single charge. It is also the most expensive vehicle on our chart at R4,061,000. The Audi RS e-tron GT takes second place in terms of acceleration, reaching 100km/h from 0 in 3.3 seconds. While it doesn’t accelerate as fast as the Porsche, Audi’s specifications show that it should be able to travel further on a single charge. Its theoretical range is 433-472km, and those lucky enough to buy one can expect to fork out R3,300,000. The rest of the cars listed are not high-performance cars per se, but each has a 0 to 100km/h acceleration time of under five seconds. The BMW iX xDrive50 launched in South Africa in early 2022, and it is the largest vehicle listed in the article. It has a price tag of R2,175,000. With a 0 to 100km/h time of 4.6 seconds, it is the fastest sports utility vehicle (SUV)-style electric car you can buy in South Africa. The Jaguar i-Pace and Volvo XC40 Recharge offer similar performance. Both produce around 300kW of power and have similar torque figures. The Jaguar i-Pace will beat the Volvo XC40 in a race to 100km/h by 0.1 seconds. However, the Volvo costs R1,200,000, while the Jaguar costs R2,000,000, making it is an expensive 0.1-second advantage. If you were to rank cars based on their South African sales numbers rather than the performance of their motors, the Mini Cooper SE would top the list. According to a BusinessDay report, Mini sold 68 Cooper SE units in 2021. It made up 31% of total EV sales in South Africa last year. Five of the highest-performing EVs that you can buy in South Africa are listed below. Where there were multiple configurations, such as the Audi e-tron, we only included the highest-specced models from each brand. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440254" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Porsche-Taycan-Turbo-S-red-on-race-track.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Porsche-Taycan-Turbo-S-red-on-race-track.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Porsche-Taycan-Turbo-S-red-on-race-track-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Porsche-Taycan-Turbo-S-red-on-race-track-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-427732" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Audi-e-tron-RS-GT-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Audi-e-tron-RS-GT-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Audi-e-tron-RS-GT--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Audi-e-tron-RS-GT--640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Audi-e-tron-RS-GT--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-432016" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMW-iX-xDrive50-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMW-iX-xDrive50-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMW-iX-xDrive50--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMW-iX-xDrive50--640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BMW-iX-xDrive50--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-429248" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jaguar-I-Pace-800-x-533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jaguar-I-Pace-800-x-533.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jaguar-I-Pace-800-x-533-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jaguar-I-Pace-800-x-533-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jaguar-I-Pace-800-x-533-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440240" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volvo-XC40-Recharge.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volvo-XC40-Recharge.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volvo-XC40-Recharge-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volvo-XC40-Recharge-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-429250" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mini-Cooper-SE-800-x-533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mini-Cooper-SE-800-x-533.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mini-Cooper-SE-800-x-533-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mini-Cooper-SE-800-x-533-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mini-Cooper-SE-800-x-533-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
