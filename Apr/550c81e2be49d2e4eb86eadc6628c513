Money may not be able to buy happiness, but that doesn’t mean it can’t buy something that will make you happy. And for those of us not constrained by financial limitations, there are many worthy purchases to make, ranging from robot dogs to flying cars. This includes whole social media services if you’re a billionaire like Elon Musk, but we avoided potential corporate take-overs for our selection. The difficulty then comes in deciding what to buy — sorting through the endless lists of consumer goods to find those notable, interesting articles worth the arm and the leg you’ll have to pay. To that end, we have done the sorting and found ten items that we think are interesting — even at some of their exorbitant price tags. Starting more modestly, the FirePit+ is ideal for camping on a less frugal budget. It creates smokeless flames with hyper-efficient air-flow technology and an X-Ray mesh body, among many other buzzwords. It also serves as a hibachi-style grill with a grill grate and can be controlled directly or with a free Bluetooth app. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441096" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FirePit.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FirePit.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FirePit-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FirePit-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If you want the cutting edge in water cutting tech, then the LiquidForce is excellent.

For an extra $300.00 (R4,378.84), you can also buy its 12-month cloud plan to let the little robot connect to a dedicated server, helping it grow and change as you care for it. It also comes with the added benefit of allowing it to join the revolution when Skynet arises. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441108" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Robot-dog.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Robot-dog.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Robot-dog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Robot-dog-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Atlas X represents the ultimate in consumer drone technology and can carry up to 35 pounds (15.88 kilograms in an actual measuring system) for 10-minute flights; and has a sleek, compact design that makes transport a breeze. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441094" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Atlas-X.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Atlas-X.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Atlas-X-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Atlas-X-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If you struggled to get into billiards, this might be an excellent way to make the game more interesting.
