This was revealed in parliament’s latest Register for Members’ Interests report, which disclosed the financial interests, benefits, and gifts received by South Africa’s government representatives. Telkom’s only other gift was a Samsung Galaxy A72 valued at R9,000, given to deputy communications minister Philly Mapulane. Samsung gave the deputy minister in the Presidency, Pinky Kekana, a R44,000 Galaxy smartphone. Kekana did not specify the model. It was the only gift from Samsung declared by ministers of parliament (MPs). Parliament’s Joint Committee on Ethics and Member’s Interests said it makes South African MPs declare the gifts and benefits they received to build trust and confidence in parliament through transparency. Every MP must disclose substantial gifts received, company holdings, and ownership of shares. MyBroadband looked at gifts received by MPs from tech companies during the reporting period.
