The highly anticipated and super-luxe The Real Housewives of Lagos. Brand-new binge-worthy shows you won’t find anywhere else. A micro-budget indie flick about one woman’s quest to protect her daughter from the Covid-crunch. The devastating South African true-crime doccie Last Blue Ride: The Hannah Cornelius Story.

Executive produced by 2022 Oscar winner and the most-memed man in the month of March, Will Smith, the brand-new Fresh Prince-inspired series Bel-Air is full of surprises. It’s set in modern-day America, but it’s also a prequel to the hit 90s sitcom. And it’s a drama, bringing a whole new take to Will’s life-altering journey from the streets of West Philly to the gated mansions of Bel-Air. This was one of Rotten Tomatoes’ Most Anticipated Shows of 2022. Binge now.
