Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency policy — which required developers to request user authorisation to access app-related data — in 2021 as a feature in iOS 14.5. However, a research paper from Kollnig et al. found that weak points in the framework allowed companies to sidestep the protections and gather even more data. “Many apps still collect device information that can be used to track users at a group level (cohort tracking) or identify individuals probabilistically (fingerprinting),” the researchers wrote. They found evidence of apps computing and agreeing on a fingerprinting-derived identifier through server-side code. Server-side scripting is an approach used in web development that involves using scripts on a web server that produces a response customised for each user’s request. “This is especially concerning because we explicitly refused opt-in to tracking in our study, and consent is a legal requirement for tracking under EU and UK data protection law,” the researchers wrote. They also found that nine iOS apps leveraged server-side code to create a “mutual user identifier” that an Alibaba subsidiary can use for cross-app tracking. “The sharing of device information for purposes of fingerprinting would be in violation of Apple’s policies, which do not allow developers to ‘derive data from a device for the purpose of uniquely identifying it,'” they wrote. Notably, they found that Apple also exempts tracking for purposes of determining a customer’s creditworthiness and that, in many cases, Apple is not required to follow its own policy. Of the apps that used SKAdNetwork, Google Firebase Analytics, and Google Crashlytics — the most widely-used libraries — most failed to disclose having access to user data. Kollnig et al. found that the Facebook SDK was slightly better, with a failure rate of 47%.
