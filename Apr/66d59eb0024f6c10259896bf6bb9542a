Samsung is working on a high-end “pro” smartwatch with a massive battery, Sammobile has reported. The publication’s sources have claimed the South Korean tech giant could be launching a Galaxy Watch 5 Pro model this year with a 572mAh battery, alongside new standard 40mm and 44mm Galaxy Watch 5 variants. The Pro variant will supposedly offer a battery that is 60% larger than the 361mAh pack available on the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm model. According to the YouTube channel TechTalkTV, the new model will not be called a “Pro” but rather an “Ultra”. Using the Ultra moniker would align the smartwatch range with Samsung’s smartphones and tablets, which also have top-end “Ultra” variants. While the smartwatch’s battery specifications have also been confirmed in a Korean certification listing, Sammobile’s sources said the company might still backtrack on the top-tier model before launch. Samsung’s switch from Tizen to Google’s Wear OS on its Galaxy 4 has brought major improvements in the software department, including access to a broader assortment of Google Play Store apps. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-409458" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Galaxy-Watch-4-new-images.png" alt="" width="800" height="598" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Galaxy-Watch-4-new-images.png 1690w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Galaxy-Watch-4-new-images-535x400.png 535w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Galaxy-Watch-4-new-images-575x430.png 575w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Galaxy-Watch-4-new-images-768x574.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Galaxy-Watch-4-new-images-1536x1148.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Galaxy-Watch-4-new-images-1200x897.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> However, its poor battery life has been a significant drawback, typically only lasting for between 24 and 26 hours. The Tizen-powered Galaxy Watch 3, by comparison, boasts a battery life of two to three days. Samsung’s Android smartwatch rival Huawei also has a host of smartwatches and fitness bands that can last two weeks between charges. Many Garmin smartwatches also offer days of use before requiring a refill. Samsung seems to be listening to the complaints, with the base Galaxy Watch 5 models also expected to ship with chunkier batteries about 10% bigger than their predecessors. According to previous Korean device certification information, the 40mm will offer a 276mAh battery than the 247mAh pack on the Galaxy Watch 4 40mm. The larger 44mm standard version will sport a 397mAh battery, 36mAh larger than the Galaxy Watch 4 44mm’s unit. It is unclear how Samsung will have to adapt the smartwatch’s chassis to allow for these increases.
