Introducing the Nespresso App – your one-stop-shop for tapping into the world of Nespresso at any time and from anywhere. The Nespresso app will also keep you updated with the latest offers, Limited Edition coffees, new product launches and more. In celebration of the Nespresso App’s local launch, Nespresso South Africa has opened up free nationwide delivery for app orders until the end of April 2022. These orders can be for Nespresso coffee, machines, and accessories, and can be delivered to your doorstep – making this the ultimate Nespresso experience.
