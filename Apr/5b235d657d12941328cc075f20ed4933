At the beginning of April, Telkom’s 2TB R699 month-to-month deal was the undisputed best large-cap king on the data market, with little competition from other mobile networks. However, Telkom no longer offers the deal on a month-to-month basis — it is only available as a 12-month contract. This new contract is still a SIM-only deal, and the price remains unchanged at R699 per month. You can opt to include a router, but this will increase the price to R769 and extend the contract term to 24-months. To gauge how well Telkom’s new offer compares in the market, we’ve put its deals side by side with uncapped 4G and 5G offerings from MTN, Rain, Axxess, and Supersonic. The following table shows Telkom’s terabyte deal compared with other uncapped SIM-only LTE offers: The table below shows Telkom’s deal compared to uncapped LTE and 5G offers with a router included:
