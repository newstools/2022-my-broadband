South Africans looking for a smartphone for R1,200 or less have several options — including some recognisable brands. One such device is a dual-SIM Samsung Galaxy A3 Core, available for R1,199 from Makro. If you’d like to buy a locally assembled device, there is the Mara S. However, you may not receive official support beyond a store warranty — at least for now. This is due to the company’s financial difficulties, which have led to the closure of its Durban factory. Phone prices were taken from Takealot and Makro and excluded promotions. Samsung’s Galaxy A3 Core offers up to 14 hours of Internet usage. The budget phone has an 8 megapixel (MP)  rear camera with autofocus and an F2.4 front camera. It also features a 1.5GHz quad-core CPU and 16GB of internal storage. <img class="wp-image-439728 size-full aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung-galaxy-A3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung-galaxy-A3.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung-galaxy-A3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung-galaxy-A3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The L210 features a quad-core 1.3GHz CPU and power-saving technology that promises to prevent the  CPU from overloading and detect and limit high power consumption.
