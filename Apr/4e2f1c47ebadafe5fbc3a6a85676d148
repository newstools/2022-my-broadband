Mercedes-Benz’s Vision EQXX concept electric car has managed an impressive feat — covering 1,000km on a single charge. The German luxury carmaker previously made the bold claim of a 1,000km range when it introduced the Vision EQXX in January 2022. It has now been proven the car is indeed capable of this in the real world through an independently-verified test drive from the southern German city Sindelfingen to the French city of Cassis. During the trip, the EQXX supposedly achieved a record-breaking low consumption figure of around 8.7kWh per 100km, meaning it consumed just 87kWh of its 100kWh battery. For comparison, the Audi e-Tron 55 has an 86.5kWh battery, which can only reach a distance of around 450km on a single charge. The consumption is also around half that of a Tesla Model S, considered one of the most energy-efficient electric vehicles currently on the market. The car had around 15% battery left at the end of the journey, which could have provided another 140km of range. <img class="size-full wp-image-441286 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/22C0141_028.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="810" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/22C0141_028.jpg 1024w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/22C0141_028-506x400.jpg 506w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/22C0141_028-674x533.jpg 674w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/22C0141_028-768x608.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Mercedes-Benz claimed it drove at typical road speeds during the trip, including a long 140km/h section on the German Autobahn. The car was also subjected to various climate conditions, including cold and rainy weather. In a blog post explaining the achievement, the company largely attributed the efficiency to the aerodynamic design of the car’s body. Bridgestone tyres designed specifically for the EQXX also featured a low rolling-resistance rating of 4.7, much lower than the 6.5 required by the EU for a top-rated Class A tyre. In addition, the EQXX’s relatively light weight of 1.7 tonnes helped to conserve energy while driving through the Swiss Alps. Many electric vehicles typically weigh around 2 tonnes or more due to the numerous batteries they pack to provide power. Mercedes-Benz said the weight efficiency was thanks to a dedicated electric chassis with a lightweight F1 subframe and aluminium brake discs. The battery pack, which was designed in cooperation with a team from the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team, also has a 50% lower volume and weighs 30% less than the pack in the mass-produced EQS. The company said that makes it suitable for fitting in a compact car. Below are more pictures of the Mercedes-Benz EQXX during its record-breaking trip.
