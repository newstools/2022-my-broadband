In today’s digital landscape, young users want to do more than simply take a photo — they want to make it a moment. This is why the all-new Galaxy A53 5G features an AI-enhanced camera experience designed to power every moment of learning, creating and exploring. You can make every photo and video pop, even in low lighting, with a camera that automatically adjusts its framerate to different light conditions. Whether you’re snapping pics alone or with friends, you can take your best Galaxy photos yet with an enhanced Portrait mode that captures depth and subject outlines more accurately. What’s more, with Fun mode, you can add playful filters to turn any gathering into an impromptu photo shoot. Sometimes, things get in the way of the perfect photo — like an accidental photobomb or a distracting glare. Using Photo Remaster, you can breathe new life into old and low-quality images or use Object eraser to remove any background distractions to create your picture-perfect shot. Take a look at the video below to learn more about how the Galaxy A53 5G’s AI camera functions make every moment awesome.
