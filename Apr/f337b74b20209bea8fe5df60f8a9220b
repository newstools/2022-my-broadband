That compares with a positivity rate of 8.7% on Feb. 23 and represented the third straight daily increase, rising from 6.2% on Tuesday. As recently as March 28 the positivity rate was 4.5%. With many Covid-19 cases going undiagnosed the positivity rate is seen as an indication of how fast the virus is spreading.
