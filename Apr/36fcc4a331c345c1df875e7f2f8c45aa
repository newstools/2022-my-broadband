South Africa’s electricity crunch could have many residents looking for backup power systems to provide light in their homes, power their Internet equipment, watch TV, or use certain appliances. MyBroadband looked at some of the cheapest backup power options available — ranging from rechargeable LED light bulbs to petrol-powered generators — to help you through bouts of load-shedding. Eskom implemented Stage 2 load-shedding earlier this week and promptly upped it to Stage 4 two days later. It was reduced to Stage 3 last night. The power utility said the current load-shedding level will remain until 05:00 on Friday, 22 April 2022. Several cost-effective options to get you through bouts of load-shedding are listed below. Several LED light bulbs with a built-in battery backup are available that charge off the mains electricity supply when the power is on. It is important to note that some rechargeable light bulbs require the switch to be turned off and back on to start running off battery power. Manufacturers boast that these can last four to five hours on a full charge. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441598" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ACDC-emergency-LED-80V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ACDC-emergency-LED-80V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ACDC-emergency-LED-80V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ACDC-emergency-LED-80V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441602" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/5W-LED-rechargeable-bulb-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/5W-LED-rechargeable-bulb-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/5W-LED-rechargeable-bulb-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/5W-LED-rechargeable-bulb-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441600" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Eurolux-800V-rechargeable.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Eurolux-800V-rechargeable.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Eurolux-800V-rechargeable-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Eurolux-800V-rechargeable-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> If your only aim is to keep your Internet up during load-shedding, a small uninterruptible power supply (UPS) or power bank with a DC port will suit your needs best. These smaller UPSes are designed to power your router and optical network terminal off of their battery storage. Several options are listed below, ranging from R446 to R1,499, depending on the manufacturer and battery capacity. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441612" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Router-charger-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Router-charger-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Router-charger-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Router-charger-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441606" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mini-UPS800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mini-UPS800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mini-UPS800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mini-UPS800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441610" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volkano-Router-UPS-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volkano-Router-UPS-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volkano-Router-UPS-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Volkano-Router-UPS-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441608" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Gizzu-Router-UPS-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Gizzu-Router-UPS-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Gizzu-Router-UPS-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Gizzu-Router-UPS-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441604" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Vizia-UPS800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Vizia-UPS800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Vizia-UPS800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Vizia-UPS800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> With many South Africans still working from home after the Covid-19 lockdowns, a backup system can be critical to power a workstation through load-shedding sessions. On the other hand, load-shedding also makes keeping yourself entertained a struggle. However, several larger UPSes are available in South Africa that can power your TV or computer. It should be noted that battery life will vary based on the voltage demand placed on the UPS. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441618" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Powercom-Raptor-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Powercom-Raptor-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Powercom-Raptor-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Powercom-Raptor-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441624" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Andowl-UPS-80V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Andowl-UPS-80V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Andowl-UPS-80V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Andowl-UPS-80V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441622" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kstar-UPS-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kstar-UPS-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kstar-UPS-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kstar-UPS-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441620" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RCT-UPS-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RCT-UPS-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RCT-UPS-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RCT-UPS-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441616" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mecer-UPS-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mecer-UPS-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mecer-UPS-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mecer-UPS-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> For those who want to power a few more appliances through load-shedding, there is a wide range of petrol-powered generators available in South Africa. Petrol generators come in different sizes with varying power outputs. Although, it should be noted that even large generators cannot power multiple power-hungry appliances — especially those with elements. However, they can help meet your needs if you wish to power appliances such as a fridge and TV, and some lights and Internet equipment. Another essential aspect when considering a petrol generator is the cost of running it. Fuel prices have been rising, and South Africans are currently paying R21.63 per litre of unleaded 93. Buyers should also ensure that the generator comes with an automatic voltage regulator if they want to power sensitive electronics with it. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441640" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Omega-generator-1-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Omega-generator-1-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Omega-generator-1-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Omega-generator-1-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441642" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ryobi-950-Gen-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ryobi-950-Gen-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ryobi-950-Gen-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ryobi-950-Gen-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441638" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ineco-Generator-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ineco-Generator-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ineco-Generator-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ineco-Generator-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-441646" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mac-Afric-2kw-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mac-Afric-2kw-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mac-Afric-2kw-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mac-Afric-2kw-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
