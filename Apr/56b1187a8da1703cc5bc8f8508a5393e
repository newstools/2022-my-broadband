Johann Rupert is one of South Africa’s most generous businessmen, and as part of his philanthropic and charity work, he has given over 2,000 title deeds to poor communities. Forbes currently ranks Rupert as South Africa’s richest person, with a net worth of $9.6 billion (R141 billion). The Rupert family’s wealth, built over decades, makes Johann Rupert an easy target among far-left socialist politicians. The tremendous value Rupert and other successful businessmen add to the country is often discounted in these attacks. Apart from employing thousands of people, Johann Rupert has been the highest individual taxpayer in South Africa for the past 20 years. Rupert’s large tax contributions help the South African government pay social grants, fund social development projects, and invest in education and healthcare. The Rupert family also has a long history of supporting South African educational institutions, educational programmes, and environmental causes. Rupert’s father, Anton, helped to establish the South African operations of the World Wide Fund for Nature and was involved in the National Parks Trust of South Africa. Rupert and his family have also supported the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund, the SA College for Tourism, and Ikamva Labantu. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-440304" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Johann-Rupert-Project-Khaya-Lam.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Johann-Rupert-Project-Khaya-Lam.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Johann-Rupert-Project-Khaya-Lam-600x338.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Johann-Rupert-Project-Khaya-Lam-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> One of the projects which Johann Rupert and his wife feels particularly strongly about is giving underprivileged people land and houses.
