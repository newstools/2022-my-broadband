Eskom has announced that load-shedding will continue until 05:00 on Friday, 22 April 2022. Stage 4 rotational power cuts are currently in effect, and the power utility said it would adjust load-shedding stages depending on the breakdowns that occur during the week. This is after Eskom chief generation officer Phillip Dukashe said earlier today that suspending load-shedding by Friday was the best-case scenario. During the same media briefing, Eskom CEO André de Ruyter explained that the power utility had no choice but to implement Stage 4 load-shedding at short notice to prevent a total collapse of the grid. He added that if a total collapse were to occur, it would take at least a week to return power. Eskom implemented Stage 2 load-shedding on Sunday, 17 April 2022, following the breakdown of four generation units at Matla, Tutuka, Duvha, and Arnot power stations. Load-shedding was then pushed to Stage 4 on Tuesday, 19 April 2022, due to further breakdowns. “A generation unit each at the Tutuka and Majuba power stations tripped this morning, adding to the failures of a unit each that had tripped at Tutuka, Camden, Matla and two units at Majuba yesterday,” Eskom said in a statement. “Since Monday, a unit each at Hendrina, Medupi, Tutuka, Arnot and two at Camden power stations have been returned to service.” Currently, Eskom has 5,124MW on planned maintenance and another 16,519MW of unplanned outages. It added that the power system remains unpredictable and that it would inform the public of any significant developments.
