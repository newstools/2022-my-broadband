Health minister Dr Joe Phaahla has extended the deadline for public comments on amendments to the Regulations Relating to the Surveillance and the Control of Notifiable Medical Conditions to 24 April 2022. The amendment aims to replace regulations enacted under South Africa’s national state of disaster to manage the Covid–19 pandemic. Phaahla first published the proposed amendments in the Government Gazette on 15 March. The initial comment deadline was tomorrow — 15 April 2022. South Africa lifted its state of disaster at midnight on 5 April, 750 days after it was first declared on 16 March 2020. However, certain rules remain in effect for another 30 days — until 5 May 2022. These include mandatory mask-wearing in indoor public spaces, one-metre physical distancing, restrictions on public gatherings, and vaccine or Covid–19 test requirements for international travellers. Phaahla’s proposed regulations would make several of these provisions permanent, including: By extending the public comment period, Phaahla effectively gives officials ten days to finalise the regulations after the deadline lapses. The ten days include a weekend and a public holiday on 2 May. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>Covid Health Regulations
