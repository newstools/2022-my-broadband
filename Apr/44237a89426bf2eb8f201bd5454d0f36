Eskom revealed that it would be approximately 3,600MW short of generation capacity to match tonight’s peak demand, meaning that Stage 4 load-shedding will remain for the time being. According to Eskom’s CEO, André de Ruyter, colder weather has resulted in an upward trend in power demands, with a peak of 30,298MW expected tonight. He explained that the power utility could supply up to around 26,700MW, leaving a shortfall of about 3,600MW. The outlook for the rest of the week is a bit more optimistic. Eskom has returned around 900MW of generation capacity to the grid, and more units are expected to return to service throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Eskom returned three units to the grid this morning, and another three are expected to come back online later today. As a result, De Ruyter indicated that there was a chance that load-shedding could be reduced to Stage 3 on Thursday and potentially lifted entirely closer to the weekend. He said that Eskom plans on returning several large units to the grid, and if they stay online, the power utility should be able to lift load-shedding entirely on Friday. De Ruyter added he was reluctant to give an exact time as the power situation in the country is still unpredictable. Eskom’s generation division general manager, Rhulani Mathebula, gave a status update on the power utility’s at-risk generation units. He explained that Eskom had reduced the potential capacity loss from at-risk units from 8,000MW yesterday, 19 April, to 6,800MW today.
