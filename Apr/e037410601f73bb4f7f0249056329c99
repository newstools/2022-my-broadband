Smartphone technology has come a long way, but these advancements have come with substantial price increases. At the very top-end, Samsung and Apple’s latest flagship smartphones sell for over R20,000. Some models are even more than R30,000 — a price that many cannot afford or are unwilling to pay. For those who want the basics that a smartphone provides without breaking the bank, there are several options available on the South African market. The most notable offerings come from Samsung, Vivo, Xiaomi, Hisense, and Mobicel. Most of these devices offer 2GB RAM, 32GB storage, and 4G LTE. Some stand out with a 13MP camera, a 5,000mAh battery, and a fingerprint scanner. Five of the best smartphones under R2,000 are listed below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-442288 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Samsung-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-442290 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VIVO.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VIVO.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VIVO-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VIVO-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-442292 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/XIAOMI.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/XIAOMI.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/XIAOMI-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/XIAOMI-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-442296 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HISNESE.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HISNESE.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HISNESE-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HISNESE-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-442298 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mOBI01.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mOBI01.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mOBI01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mOBI01-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
