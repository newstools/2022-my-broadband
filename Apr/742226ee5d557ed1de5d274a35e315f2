When asset-based decisions are driven by inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete data, there could be numerous unwanted implications for your business. Via the installation of specially delivered software, computers can be traced, and an alert will be sent as soon as they are connected to the internet. Devices can also be locked from usage, remotely wiped of data, and can even be setup to “auto freeze” if it has not been on a specific network for a determined and set timeframe. An asset management service allows businesses to adhere to asset audits and compliance specifications. Businesses should be pro-active in securing their assets, with the looting activities in July 2021 a prime example, Stolen devices can be remotely frozen with a custom message along with several predefined and customised alerts depending on client requirements. “With data becoming an increasingly valuable commodity, the devices on which data is stored need the right level of protection.” “With Ctrack PC Secure, we are expanding our all-encompassing business solutions to cater for this exact need,” concluded Jordt. A slick one-page application for your business is required to start the process, and a once off activation fee of R199 excl. Vat and a R95 excl.
