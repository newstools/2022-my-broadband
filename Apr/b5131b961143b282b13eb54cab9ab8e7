Eskom has announced that load-shedding will be reduced from Stage 4 to Stage 3 at 22:00 on Wednesday, 20 April 2022. The power utility said it could lower the level of load-shedding because six power generation units came back online in the past 24 hours. It expects another three to return to the grid on Thursday. “A generation unit each at the Arnot and Kendal power stations returned to service during the day, adding to the two Lethabo units, and one each at Camden and Matla power stations that returned to service during the night,” Eskom said in a statement. “A unit each at the Majuba, Matimba and Arnot power stations are set to return to service by tomorrow.” It added that current outages total 20,046MW — of which 5,787MW is planned maintenance, and 14,259 MW are breakdowns. The return to service of more units on Thursday will boost generation capacity and ease pressure on the grid ahead of the weekend. Eskom also said it expects power demand to reduce over the weekend. The state-owned power utility implemented Stage 2 load-shedding at short notice on Sunday, 17 April, and promptly upped the power cuts to Stage 4 on Tuesday, 19 April. The sudden onset of power cuts was due to unit losses, delayed return-to-service of generators, and increased demand due to colder weather.
