A new leak from technology insider Enthusiastic Citizen states that Intel’s upcoming range of desktop graphics cards is likely getting delayed again, reports Wccftech. According to the report, Intel is postponing its Arc Alchemist GPU launch to late Q2 or the start of 2022’s third quarter. The reason for the delay is unknown, but previous reports indicated Intel would rather delay its first-ever desktop GPU launch than botch it. Considering Intel’s mobile Arc A-series cards are still exclusive to Korea, it is not surprising that the company is trying to avoid a similar situation with its desktop GPUs. The alleged delay aligns with a recent announcement that the Arc S Limited Edition graphics cards would launch “this summer” — between 28 May and 5 September. Details regarding the Arc A-series model variations have also been included in the leak — Intel will reportedly release four GPUs initially, followed by a possible fifth model. The four initial models are Arc A770, A750, A580, and A380. Additionally, the leak suggests the A770 card’s performance will be on par with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, while the entry-level A380 will offer performance similar to AMD’s Radeon RX 4600. Previous leaks have confirmed the A770 and A380’s existence, but there have been no such leaks for the A750 and A580 cards. If Intel’s Arc A-Series Mobile A770M GPU is anything to go by, the A770 desktop card should come with 16GB RAM. However, Citizen’s leak states that the A770 will feature either 10 GB or 8 GB RAM, with rumours pointing to an A970 as the top-of-the-line GPU.
