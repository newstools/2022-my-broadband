While many segments of South Africa’s economy have been struggling to keep heads above water amid the Covid-19 pandemic, one has been flourishing — tech. Across the world, technology firms have generally benefitted from the disruption that came from the crisis, with their innovative solutions offering alternatives to the ways of life that were no longer possible due to strict curbs on movement and business activity. Zoom’s shares boomed because it offered a competent and free video-conferencing tool that appealed to businesses and home users. Adoption of Microsoft’s Teams remote working software surged from 20 million daily active users in November 2019 to 75 million in April 2020. It then climbed to 145 million a year later. Ecommerce sites like Amazon and Takealot also experienced tremendous growth as more people preferred or were required to shop online. These changes have shown the potential of technological innovation in ensuring sustainable businesses and led to investors pouring billions more into the tech. In South Africa, one particular area has received most of the attention — financial technology (fintech), including cryptocurrency. Fintech firms like iKhoka and Yoco are making it more affordable for informal and small-scale traders to offer their customers the ability to pay with cards. Cryptocurrency platforms such as VALR and Luno make it easier for the average South African to buy and trade digital assets. Here are several South African tech companies that have amassed millions or even billions in funding since the start of 2021. Car subscription marketplace FlexClub received $5 million (R74 million) as a part of a seed extension round that brought its total investment to around $6.2 million (R92 million) since its founding in 2019. The brainchild of Marlon Gallardo, Rudolf Vavruch and Tinashe Ruzanne, FlexClub is an online marketplace that provides customers with flexible access to long-term car rentals. It has specially tailored an offering toward ride-hailing drivers that cannot afford or don’t qualify for vehicle financing. It even has a dedicated section for Uber drivers on its website. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440576" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FlexClub-website.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FlexClub-website.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FlexClub-website-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FlexClub-website-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Patrice Motsepe’s African Rainbow Capital recently spent R1.5 billion to buy a 37.33% stake in the Crossfin Technology Group. Crossfin will use the money to continue growing its portfolio of businesses, including iKhokha, a bank-agnostic payments company first launched at the end of 2014. Since then, it has grown its footprint to over 35,000 merchants, supporting the growth of SMEs with low-cost mobile point-of-sale devices. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440422" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iKhoka-machine-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iKhoka-machine-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iKhoka-machine--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iKhoka-machine--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Mobiz integrates hyper-personalisation into mobile marketing with a code-free tool that allows marketers, enterprises, and small to medium businesses to create and send SMS campaigns to their customers. Founder and CEO Greg Chen established the company in 2014, building on his 15 years of experience in the mobile industry. In November 2021, the startup announced it had raised pre-Series A round funding of $4 million (R59 million) from HAVAÍC, Futuregrowth, Launch Africa, Allan Gray E-Squared Ventures, CapaciTech and Endeavor’s Harvest Fund.

The technology giant invested R120 million in Naked, with the firm’s existing investors, Yellowwoods and Hollard, also participating. Naked offers users the ability to take out short-term insurance cover on their home, car, or individual possessions via an app or browser. The app uses a set of questions posed by a chatbot and combines the answers with artificial intelligence to calculate a premium in less than two minutes. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440458" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Naked-Insurance-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Naked-Insurance-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Naked-Insurance--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Naked-Insurance--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Specialised warehousing and distribution management company Parcelninja offloaded a 60% share of its business to JSE-listed logistics giant Imperial in February 2021.

Combined with the previous round, Tyme has amassed $180 million (R2.66 billion), which will go towards growing TymeBank in South Africa and funding GOTyme in the Philippines. As recently pointed out in the Solidarity Research Institute’s 2022 Bank Charges report, TymeBank offers the cheapest banking account in South Africa. One of the bank’s distinctive services is the ability to print a card with initials from one of its kiosks, located at various Pick n Pay outlets across the country. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440412" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TymeBank-image-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TymeBank-image-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TymeBank-image--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/TymeBank-image--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The cryptocurrency platform is barely three years old but is already worth an estimated R3.7 billion.

The funding came from Alameda Research, Cadenza, CMT Digital, Coinbase Ventures, Distributed Global, GSR, Third Prime and Avon Ventures, and existing investors Bittrex and 4Di Capital, among others. Partner at Pantera Capital, Paul Veradittakit, who spearheaded the funding drive, believes Africa has a bright future for the adoption of cryptocurrencies for both asset diversification and payments. “VALR brings an amazing product and service to onboard both retail customers and institutions,” he said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-440414" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VALR-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VALR-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VALR--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VALR--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Payments gateway company Ozow recently announced it had secured Series B funding of $48 million (R709 million).
