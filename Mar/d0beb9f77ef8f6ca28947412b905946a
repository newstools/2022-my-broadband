Putting elegance in the palm of your hand, the HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition is ushering in a new era of foldable beauty. This eye-catching smartphone is designed in collaboration with the talented Dutch haute couture designer, Iris Van Herpen. Herpen’s designs are a fusion of technology-infused elements in whimsical haute couture, which is evident in the HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition. Now available for pre-order, the visually stunning HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition packs everything consumers have come to expect from a flagship device into a foldable form. The HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition is truly the foldable smartphone of your dreams. The two screens unfold into a perfectly flat and smooth screen, creating a visual feast for the user. Huawei’s unique all-new multi-dimensional hinge design provides a large bending radius while reducing stress and allowing a shallow crease on the screen. This results in a thinner smartphone with less convex on the back cover. When unfolded, the HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition features a 6.9-inch flexible OLED screen with a 21:9 aspect ratio. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-438426" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Huawei-P50-Pocket-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Huawei-P50-Pocket-1.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Huawei-P50-Pocket-1-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Huawei-P50-Pocket-1-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This provides users with a brilliant cinematic experience. Featuring a pixel density of 442ppi supporting more than one billion colours, the screens ensure all colours and intricate details are visible. The screen brightness adapts to surrounding light so users’ eyes are constantly protected. Even in outdoor areas where the sunlight is strong, content on the display will remain legible. The adaptive brightness feature can also dynamically adjust the display brightness and optimise the viewing experience. Huawei has also introduced a new anti-reflection nano optical layer to the HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition’s main screen, bringing with it an extremely low reflectivity, making it perfect to counteract the effects that the crease may have on the visual experience. The cover screen of the HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition displays notifications, schedule, calendar, music and weather while also allowing control of other features. A range of vibrant themes are available so users can completely customise the experience. Content and services seamlessly flow between both screens and users can access the camera from the cover screen. After capturing photos or videos while the HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition is folded, users can view the captured media on the Cover Screen. By unfolding the HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition, users can pick up a call and fold it again to end the call. The HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition offers a unique photography experience through its new Ultra Spectrum Camera System. This includes a triple-lens rear camera setup comprising a 40MP True-Chroma camera, a 13MP Ultra-Wide Angle camera, a 32MP Ultra Spectrum camera and a 10.7MP front camera. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-438428" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Huawei-P50-Pocket-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Huawei-P50-Pocket-2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Huawei-P50-Pocket-2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Huawei-P50-Pocket-2-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Featuring the unique Ultra Spectrum Fluorescence Photography feature, the HUAWEI P50 Pocket Premium Edition delivers more depth and layers in photos and videos.
