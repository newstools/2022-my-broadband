The HUAWEI MatePad T 10s 64GB, a lightweight and powerful 10.1-inch tablet that offers best-in-class multimedia capabilities, is now available in South Africa. The tablet’s Full HD display with HUAWEI ClariVu Display Enhancement Technology ensures the finest detail comes through with incredible colour vibrancy, working alongside a powerful dual-speaker audio system to deliver an immersive experience, whether the tablet is used for watching movies or gaming. Embedded in the tablet is the Kirin 710A, which supports powerful performance and a range of smart and family-friendly features that EMUI 10.1 has on offer. The new HUAWEI MatePad T 10s is built for entertaining the whole family. It features a simple yet practical design that incorporates a premium metal body, and is light enough for the kids in the family to use. The tablet utilises a strong geometric design language with slim bezels surrounding the display, creating perfect symmetry on the front. The sides of the tablet are curved to fit comfortably in the hand, and reinforced edges provide additional protection against drop damage and shock from minor impacts. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-436582 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Image-1-595x400.png" alt="" width="595" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Image-1-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Image-1-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Image-1.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 85vw, 595px" /> The HUAWEI MatePad T 10s features a Full HD IPS panel supporting a resolution of 1920×1200 and 70 percent of the NTSC colour gamut (typical value). At 10.1 inches, the 16:10 display has a high pixel density of 224ppi to ensure detail in any image or video is presented with impeccable sharpness. The display also supports HUAWEI ClariVu Display Enhancement technology, which dynamically optimises colour, brightness and saturation, as well as a Huawei-developed Super Resolution algorithm that scales up lower-res content for a more immersive experience. From an audio perspective, Harman Kardon amplitude speakers are located symmetrically on the sides of the HUAWEI MatePad T 10s. The speakers have been redesigned to allow for a longer stroke path than traditional audio systems in tablets, ensuring the tablet can achieve a higher audio volume with low distortion. HUAWEI Histen 6.1 enables the support of 9.1-channel 3D surround sound with options for users to configure the audio experience according to their preference, as well as Bass Booster, which offers smart optimisation that enhances the bass. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-436584 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Image-2-595x400.png" alt="" width="595" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Image-2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Image-2-300x202.png 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Image-2.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 85vw, 595px" /> The HUAWEI MatePad T 10s comes with EMUI 10.1, which adds versatility to the media-centric tablet with a range of smart features in an intuitive and responsive UI.
