There’s a clever meme doing the rounds that sums up the business experiences of the past year—and it’s especially apt in the banking and finance sector: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-437728" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pic-1-HPE.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="367" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pic-1-HPE.jpg 958w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pic-1-HPE-600x344.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pic-1-HPE-800x459.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pic-1-HPE-768x441.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Overdue digital transformations were already under way in the finance sector when the pandemic arrived and rapidly truncated timelines. Projects initially planned to roll out over years were implemented in mere weeks. The big insight from the pandemic? When stress-tested, humans can innovate remarkable solutions to intractable problems. Similarly, this is how HCI was born: out of the need to solve business problems in a rapidly changing environment. In its simplest form, HCI allows you to scale by adding preconfigured building blocks. It also has the additional benefits of easy deployment, simplified management, automated configuration and one-click software upgrades. Additional nodes of both compute and storage can be added to the pool of storage and compute resources, as needed. The big promise was that, by simplifying management and configuration, the manual burden on IT staff would be reduced and those valuable human resources who were fighting fires could instead be freed to innovate. HCI was the ‘silver bullet’ that allowed organisations to scale fast, spin up VMs on demand and provision resources as required. As organisations started to widely adopt HCI, it became apparent that HCI could become wasteful. These organisations noticed that they needed to add more physical resources (CPU, memory, and storage). But, due to architectural limitations of traditional HCI, all these components need to be added at the same time, usually resulting in underutilised assets. Traditional HCI solutions were not always able to meet the low latency and high availability needs of mission-critical business applications. Traditional HCI was sold as a one platform for all workloads, but in short, HCI’s architecture is fundamentally flawed, because it requires trade-offs between simplicity and performance, which compromises its one-size-fits-all approach. HCI is ideal for predictable, non-intensive workloads, but IT infrastructures in the financial industry have struggled to bear the burden of heavier workloads brought on by remote transactions, virtual working, and unpredictable growth of data. For customer-facing financial institutions, any disruption can mean an unacceptable loss of service. As Tony Pannone, CIO of Highmark Federal Credit Union, in Rapid City, South Dakota, puts it: “Everybody expects access to their money instantly.” “And whether that delivery channel is through a mobile app, through a website, coming into a branch, or an ATM, you need your data connectivity. It’s not a matter of waiting ten seconds, it’s a matter of, it’s got to be there.”
