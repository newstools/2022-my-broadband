South African tech stocks have experienced a lot of volatility over the last decade, with the best-performing share, Alaris, gaining 1,100% and the worst-performing share, Ellies, losing 90.2%. The global tech stock rally over the last decade has also ended abruptly because of interest rate concerns, the Chinese government cracking down on tech giants, and the war in Ukraine. Alibaba, for example, plummeted from a high of around $300 to under $100 over the last eighteen months. Many US tech giants like Facebook, now known as Meta, was also not spared. Its share price plummeted from $382 in September 2021 to under $190 now. The bad news is that many analysts expect the tough trading conditions and volatility to continue. Inflation in the United States are at a 40-year high, and the most investors expect the Federal Reserve to implement several rate hikes. As if conditions were not bad enough, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent spike in the oil price further dampened investor confidence. Many South African tech shares were hit as part of the global selloff, with the worst-hit stocks losing over 20% in value in the first two months of the year.
