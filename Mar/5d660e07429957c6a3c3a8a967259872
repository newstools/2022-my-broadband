MTN has announced price hikes for its contract packages which will come into effect from 1 May 2022. The company said an inflationary environment has significantly contributed to increased input costs, compelling it to react to sustained market pressures. “We have tried to keep the price increases to a minimum in a bid to provide our customers with quality telecommunications services as cost-effectively as possible,” said MTN SA chief consumer officer Mapula Bodibe. “The tariffs will be an average increase of 5%, which is in line with inflation and comparable to the market.” Vodacom announced contract price increases at the beginning of March, set to kick in on Friday. Bodibe said that MTN hadn’t adjusted its contract prices over the past two years despite the challenging economic environment caused by Covid–19. “On the other hand, we have made substantial investments into our network to ensure our customers enjoy world class connectivity,” she said. MTN said it had informed existing contract customers about the price increases. The exact increase date may vary depending on a subscriber’s billing cycle. MTN assured that all terms and conditions would remain the same, and there won’t be any changes in the current discounts.
