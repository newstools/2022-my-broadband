Vodacom has announced price hikes across its range of contract price plans, which will take effect on 1 April 2022. The mobile network operator said it capped the increases at 5.3%, and that the increases would only apply to subscription fees. Instalments on devices will not be affected by the increase. “The Covid–19 landscape has led to an increased digital demand as we take much of our personal and professional lives online,” Vodacom stated. “As a result, we’ve been working hard behind the scenes to continue to provide you with a quality service.” Vodacom said cost increases are unavoidable in all industries, and that it is committed to keeping them as low as possible. It invited subscribers to contact its customer support on 082 135 if they have any questions, or visit a Vodacom store to speak with a consultant.
