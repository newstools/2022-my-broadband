MyBroadband is giving away R5 000 cash to encourage you to do a speed test and rate the service you receive from your ISP. MyBroadband’s speed test platforms – MyBroadband Speed Test and Speedtest.co.za – make it easy for you to test your Internet connection’s download speed, upload speed, and latency. After the speed test is completed, you can also rate your ISP. These ratings are used for reports that rank South African Internet service providers. MyBroadband’s speed test servers are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres to ensure a neutral testing environment. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators present at its peering points are provided with a free 10Gbps connection to MyBroadband’s speed test platform. MyBroadband is giving away R5 000 cash to encourage you to do a speed test. To enter: The giveaway will run until Friday, 18 March 2022, and the winners will be announced shortly afterwards.
