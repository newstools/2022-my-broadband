The Winamp Foundation has launched the Winamp NFT initiative and will put the original media player’s 1997 graphical skin up for auction as a non-fungible token (NFT). The auction will be accessible through OpenSea and will start on 16 May and last until 22 May. All the proceeds from the auction will go to charity projects that support musicians. Winamp has also invited artists to submit artworks derived from the original Winamp skin. It will select 20 of these derivatives and sell them as NFTs from 23 May. The derivatives will all sell for 0.08 Ethereum, which was equivalent to R3,373 at the time of publication. If an artist’s submission is selected, they transfer all their work’s intellectual property to Winamp. Selected artists will receive 20% of the primary sale and 10% of the proceeds of secondary sales. The rest of the proceeds will go to charity. Buyers will get a blockchain token linked to an image of the original skin or a derivative, of which they will own the rights to copy, reproduce and display, The Verge reported. Artists can submit their artwork until 14 April.
