At the time of publication, this portal showed that all services under mobile banking and Internet banking were unavailable. Card payments, cellular banking, ATMs, and branch services remain unaffected by the downtime. Standard Bank recommended customers who wanted to transact on their mobile phone use cellphone banking as an alternative by dialling *120*2345#. Downdetector showed a surge in reports of issues with Standard Bank services from around 06:24 on Friday morning. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-438788 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Standard-Bank-outage_Downdetector_25-March-2022.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="315" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Standard-Bank-outage_Downdetector_25-March-2022.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Standard-Bank-outage_Downdetector_25-March-2022-600x236.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Standard-Bank-outage_Downdetector_25-March-2022-768x302.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MyBroadband has reported on several Standard Bank app or Internet banking outages in the past year.
