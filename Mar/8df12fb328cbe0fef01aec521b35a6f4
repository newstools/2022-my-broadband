Vodacom South Africa managing director Balesh Sharma has resigned from the Vodafone and Vodacom groups, with effect from 30 June 2022. Sharma is leaving the company after a two-decade-long career. He was appointed as the managing director for Vodacom South Africa in September 2020. He will remain in the position until he leaves in June. “This is the end of a momentous chapter in my career and I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my Vodafone and Vodacom families for the extraordinary opportunities afforded to me over the last twenty years,” Sharma said. “It has been wonderful to be part of a purpose-led organisation which has allowed me to work all over the world and to forge friendships with so many diverse communities and people.” Vodacom Group CEO, Shameel Joosub, shared his appreciation for Sharma’s time with the company. “I would like to offer my deepest gratitude to Balesh for his invaluable contribution in the establishment of Vodacom South Africa,” Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub said. “During this time, he led the improvements in market share, net promoter scores, network, churn improvement, TOBI, Vodacom Business performance and also drove the winning back of data market share.” Joosub also said that Sharma played a critical role for Vodacom in the recent spectrum auction, where the telecoms company successfully bought 110MHz of high demand spectrum. “We wish Balesh the very best for the next chapter of his career and will announce his successor in due course,” he added. Before working for Vodacom South Africa, Sharma had worked in several leadership roles for Vodafone, including CEO positions in Malta and Czech Republic.
