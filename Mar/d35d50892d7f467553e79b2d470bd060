The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has announced the conclusion of the much-anticipated high-demand radio frequency spectrum auction. The auction involved six qualified bidders: Cell C, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, MTN, Rain Networks, Telkom, and Vodacom. Between the six operators, they bid just less than R14.5 billion to acquire sough-after cellular network capacity to help build out their 4G and 5G networks. If collected, the money will go to the national fiscus. Icasa reported that the main auction stage, which ran from 10 to 17 March, comprised 58 rounds of bidding. There was one unsold spectrum lot of 2x10MHz in the IMT800 Band. Icasa will license this spectrum in future. “The next stage in the auction process will be the assignment round, which is purely an administrative process and will be held on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, to determine the actual spectrum ranges to be assigned for all the lots bought in the various bands,” Icasa stated. “This was our inaugural radio frequency spectrum auction, and we are really grateful to have reached this stage without any hassles and challenges from the first day of the actual auction to date,” said Icasa chairperson Dr Keabetswe Modimoeng. “This shows South Africa’s capability as an investment- friendly destination.” Modimoeng also thanked the Icasa staff involved for their stamina and commitment to ensuring that the spectrum licensing process completes successfully. “This auction was indeed in the best interest of all South Africans, as will be the subsequent licensing interventions post government’s revision of the Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN) Policy,” Modimoeng stated.
