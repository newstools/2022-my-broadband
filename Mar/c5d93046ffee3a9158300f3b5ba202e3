Transport minister Fikile Mbalula will provide an update on the deadline for the extension of driver’s licence card validity on Thursday, 31 March 2022. The announcement comes after the Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) warned that the grace period for renewing driving licences tomorrow could result in a big spike in traffic fines and denied car insurance claims. It stated that hundreds of thousands of drivers with expired licences had not yet applied for their new cards and appealed to the government to reconsider its refusal to extend the deadline. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula previously extended the deadline for licences that expired between 26 March 2020 and 31 August 2021 until 31 March 2022. That was intended to help the system catch up with a backlog of 1.2 million expired licence cards that motorists hadn’t renewed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But by February, Mbalula indicated that the total backlog of licences that will expire on 31 March stood at 2.1 million. The worsening of the backlog was caused by South Africa’s only card printing machine breaking down in November. It was damaged by a power surge caused when an adjacent building flooded. While the licence card printing machine has returned to service, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) estimated that more than a million motorists will still have expired licences come 1 April 2022. The AA said given the recent problems with the production of driving licences cards, and issues around Driving Licence Testing Centres (DLTCs) and online booking systems, it was unrealistic to expect that this enormous backlog would be cleared by the end of the month. “This leaves hundreds of thousands of drivers without the necessary documents to be on the road legally,” the AA said. The association said that unless traffic law enforcement agencies understood the problems and found a way to address them, South Africa could see a massive spike in traffic fines for expired licence cards issued to motorists in the coming months. Outa has also called for law enforcement agencies to get official instruction not to issue fines to motorists whose driver’s licence cards expired in the past 12 months. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-430694" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Traffic-fine-new-headline-fixed-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Traffic-fine-new-headline-fixed-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Traffic-fine-new-headline-fixed--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Traffic-fine-new-headline-fixed--640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Traffic-fine-new-headline-fixed--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In addition, insurance companies could repudiate more accident claims if more motorists are driving with expired licences. “Although those who have applied for new licences are covered through an extension of the validity of their licences, there are still many drivers who have not applied for renewed licences for various reasons beyond their control,” the AA said. The AA added the government should provide an environment conducive to renewing these documents, and the necessary backup systems to ensure timely production and delivery. “This is currently not the case in the majority of DLTCs and is creating a situation that will, effectively, criminalise those who could not apply for renewals through no fault of their own,” the association stated. The only practical solution was for the government to extend the grace period and ensure all DLTCs and systems were geared to accommodate the backlogs. “Failing this, motorists will, unfortunately, make the decision to drive illegally as they still must remain mobile, whatever the consequences. This is a situation which suits no one in the country,” the AA said. The AA also urged the government to urgently finalise plans to extend the validity period of driving licences from five to 10 years. “Minister Mbalula in February indicated that research is being conducted into extending the validity period of driving licence cards from the current five-year period,” the AA  stated. “This research should now be completed and is, in our view, the most practical way forward. It’s now incumbent on government to implement this change as a pragmatic way of dealing with driving licence issues now and into the future,” concludes the AA.
