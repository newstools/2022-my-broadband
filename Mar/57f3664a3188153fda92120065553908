Apple Inc. announced plans to hold its first product unveiling of 2022 on March 8, kicking off what’s expected to be its biggest year ever in terms of new devices. In an invitation sent out Wednesday, Apple confirmed a date that was previously reported by Bloomberg News. At the event, the company is expected to announce its first low-cost iPhone SE with 5G capabilities, a new iPad Air and updated Macs with Apple-made chips. The showcase will occur virtually, continuing the approach Apple adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The event, promoted with the tagline “Peek performance,” will get underway at 10 a.m. Pacific time. The presentation will be streamed on Apple’s website, but the company also typically hosts its virtual keynotes on Google’s YouTube and other social media websites. Last October, Apple announced the latest MacBook Pros and AirPods. Next week’s event is likely to be one of several in the coming months, with the company planning an ambitious upgrade cycle in 2022. The new products are expected to include the iPhone 14 line, as many as three updated Apple Watch models, several new Macs with custom chips, a revamped iPad Pro and possibly a preview of an upcoming mixed-reality headset. At next week’s presentation, the company is planning to unveil its first update to the iPhone SE since 2020, adding 5G networking to the current design. The phone is also expected to include a processor and camera upgrade. Apple also may show off its first update to the iPad Air since 2020, with the device getting 5G and a newer chip. Apple plans to announce at least one new Mac as well, with more new machines coming around May or June and in the fall. The company is planning a new entry-level MacBook Pro with an M2 chip, an upgraded Mac mini geared toward professionals and a higher-end iMac this year.
