OPPO’s latest addition to its incredible smartphone line-up is the Reno7 5G – and it is on its way to South Africa. The OPPO Reno7 5G is equipped with 65W 65W SUPERVOOC fast-charging, 5G connectivity, 8GB RAM, and 256GB storage – but its best feature is its amazing camera. One of OPPO’s goals has been to provide users with cameras that put DSLR-level photography in the palm of their hand. It has achieved this with the OPPO Reno7 5G, which is fitted with a camera array that comprises a 64MP main lens, an 8MP 118-degree ultra-wide-angle lens, a 2MP macro lens, and a 32MP front camera. This camera offers an AI-enhanced Portrait Mode, giving you unmatched control over the depth of field, and boasts the most customisable bokeh effect on any smartphone yet. OPPO’s proprietary super-resolution algorithm then upscales your photos to provide you with 108MP ultra-clear images. <img class="size-medium wp-image-439436 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OPPO-body-1-595x400.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="400" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OPPO-body-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OPPO-body-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OPPO-body-1.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 85vw, 595px" /> Along with this camera, OPPO has packed powerful hardware into the Reno7 5G to take care of all your performance needs – including an octa-core processor and 8GB RAM. You can also expand your RAM by up to an additional 5GB by using the Reno7 5G’s 256GB storage for a performance boost when you need it. This lets the Reno7 5G offer an awesome gaming performance, an experience that is enhanced by its HyperBoost AI Frame Rate Stabilizer and the display’s 90Hz refresh rate. Additionally, OPPO has incorporated a multi-cooling system – comprising multi-layer graphite sheets, liquid cooling, and aerospace-grade insulation – for better thermal control, as well as five sensors for real-time temperature monitoring. Another great benefit of the OPPO Reno7 5G is 65W SUPERVOOC fast-charging. This means your Reno7 5G only needs to charge for five minutes to provide you with an incredible two hours of intensive gaming. Furthermore, the 4,500mAh battery will reach a full charge in just 35 minutes to keep your smartphone powered all day. Click here to find out more about the OPPO Reno7 5G now.
