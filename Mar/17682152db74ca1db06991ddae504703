Google is advertising ten jobs in South Africa, including technical, business development, and marketing positions. The company has over 150,000 employees worldwide and is known for its staff perks, such as free food and snacks and generous maternity leave. Google set up an office in 2007, located in Bryanston and run by Stafford Masie — the company’s first South African country manager. Upon its establishment in South Africa, the office initially only catered for a small group of employees and used shared office space at The Campus in Bryanston. As its presence — and employee base — in South Africa grew, Google expanded its South African offices in 2015. This included a move to its own dedicated office space, also located in Bryanston. The new offices included new perks for employees, including a canteen, chill zone, and games room. In January 2020, the company appointed a new country director for South Africa, Alistair Mokoena. Google has, for some time, invested in South Africa through several initiatives. Earlier this year, the tech giant announced plans to provide support for startups, SMMEs and nonprofits in the country. Google also announced it would be giving $500,000 in funding and training to Gift of the Givers and Food for Life South Africa to support their economic recovery. “To date, 22 South African nonprofit organisations have tapped into $6.5 million in Google.org grants to bolster their work supporting under-served Black youth, SMMEs, and women with skills and knowledge to improve their livelihoods,” Mokoena said. The positions advertised include a customer engineer for Google Cloud, a Data Centre IT Infrastructure Manager, and a Product Marketing Manager for consumer applications.
