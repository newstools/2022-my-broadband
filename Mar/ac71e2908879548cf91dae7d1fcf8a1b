Samsung unveiled its latest additions to the budget-friendly smartphone line — the A53 5G and A33 5G — during its Awesome Galaxy A event on Thursday, 17 March 2022. The new models both boast 5G connectivity, an ambient-edge camera bump, and slimmer bezels than their predecessors. Both devices appear similar in design, with rounded edges and a quadruple rear camera setup. The A53 5G has a hole-punch selfie camera, while the A33 5G’s has a teardrop style front camera. Users need not worry too much about damage from water and dust, as both smartphones feature IP67 protection ratings. When it comes to processors, both devices feature an Exynos 1280 (5nm) octa-core chip. Samsung claimed that the new chip provides 33% faster graphics performance, and its neural processor is 43% faster than its predecessors. Both smartphones come with 128GB of internal storage and either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. The A53 5G’s has a 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The A33 5G’s display, while featuring the same technology, is 0.1 inches smaller and has a 90Hz refresh rate. Both devices feature improved blue light filtering and provide better outdoor display visibility. The design of the smartphones’ camera setup has been updated. They now both feature what Samsung calls an ambient-edge camera bump, while their predecessors’ setups featured only slightly protruding lenses. The A53 5G packs a 64MP main sensor, 12MP ultrawide, 5MP depth sensor, and 5MP macro lens. The A33 5G’s camera setup features a 48MP main sensor, 8MP ultrawide, 2MP depth sensor, and the same macro lens as its counterpart. With improved optical image stabilisation, Samsung said the smartphones provide significantly improved video recording capabilities. Samsung claims that the 5,000mAh contained in both models will provide up to two days of battery life, and the devices support 25W fast charging. They also run the same operating system featured on Samsung’s flagship S22 line — One Ui 4.1, based on Android 12. Samsung said the A53 5G and A33 5G would receive extended software updates for at least four generations. Both devices come in black, white, blue, and peach. However, Samsung South Africa’s website currently only shows the A53 5G available for pre-order in blue and black. The A53 5G can be pre-ordered for R8,495, and shipping will commence from 31 March 2022. Currently, only the 128GB storage configuration is listed on Samsung South Africa’s product page. Samsung’s A33 5G will be available from 22 April 2022 onwards and is priced at €379 in Europe. South African pricing is yet to be revealed.
