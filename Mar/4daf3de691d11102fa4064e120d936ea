Huawei has launched its first foldable smartphone in South Africa — the P50 Pocket. The clamshell-style smartphone takes on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3, which offers a similar form factor. The P50 Pocket’s screen folds horizontally down the middle into a more compact square that can fit into small pockets. Huawei will only be offering the Premium Edition in South Africa, which comes with distinctive flowing patterns in a gold finish. It was designed in collaboration with Haute Couture’s Iris van Herpen and is clearly geared towards the fashion-conscious user. One of its unique features is a sunscreen detector in the camera window, which uses the phone’s ultra-spectrum camera and a UV emitter to detect sunscreen on the user’s face and guide them to applying a sufficient amount. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-437702" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/P50-Pocket-Gold-finish-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/P50-Pocket-Gold-finish.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/P50-Pocket-Gold-finish-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/P50-Pocket-Gold-finish-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> When unfolded, the P50 Pocket boasts a conventional smartphone shape with the main OLED screen measuring 6.9 inches. This display has a resolution of 2,790 x 1,188 and a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. At the top of the screen is a hole-punch selfie camera with a 10.7MP sensor. On the rear of the P50 Pocket, there are two circular windows. The top window houses the primary camera system, consisting of a 40MP main camera, 13MP ultrawide, and 32MP ultra-spectrum sensor for better colour reproduction. The bottom window is a 1.04-inch circular screen with a 340 x 340 resolution. It can display the date, time, and app notifications and be used to control the main camera while the phone is folded. On the inside, the P50 Pocket packs powerful hardware, including a Snapdragon 888 chip paired with 12GB RAM and 512GB storage in the Premium Edition. This comes alongside a 4,000mAh battery with support for 40W fast charging, capable of filling the battery from 0-70% in around 30 minutes. Unlike most flagships these days, it does not offer wireless charging. The Huawei P50 Pocket Premium Edition will be available for pre-order in South Africa from 22 March 2022, with general availability from 1 April. It will be priced at R28,999, although those who pay a pre-order deposit of R199 on the Huawei Online Store will get a discount of up to R2,999. Pre-orders of the Huawei P50 Pocket will also receive free gifts valued at R3,999. Below are specifications and images of the Huawei P50 Premium edition.
