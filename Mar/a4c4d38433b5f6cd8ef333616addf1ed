Acer’s Aspire Vero laptop is built from recycled plastic as part of Acer’s commitment to protecting the environment. Every element of this laptop was built with sustainability in mind – from its recycled plastic shell, to its battery management app – making it a must for those who want to go green. The Acer Aspire Vero’s chassis is built with 30% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic – which reduces CO2 emissions by about 21% during the production process. The Aspire Vero’s chassis is also paint-free, which lowers the negative impact of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the environment. Additionally, the Aspire Vero’s keycaps are made from 50% PCR plastics, and the ‘R’ and ‘E’ keys have been reversed to emphasize the three important messages of environmental awareness: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Making this particularly impressive is that Acer has used these eco-friendly materials while maintaining the world-class build quality of the laptop. This is important, to ensure customers don’t have to compromise on quality to be environmentally responsible.  <img class="aligncenter wp-image-436082 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/In-article-image-Acer-Aspire-Vero-March-2022.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/In-article-image-Acer-Aspire-Vero-March-2022.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/In-article-image-Acer-Aspire-Vero-March-2022-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/In-article-image-Acer-Aspire-Vero-March-2022-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The focus on sustainability does not stop there, however, and the Acer Aspire Vero leverages VeroSense to provide smart battery management to its users.
