Samsung launched a trade-in promotion with its Galaxy S22 range, offering a flat R10,000 off on its new flagships, but we found you could get greater discounts if you use a third-party service — depending on what you traded in. The best deals on iPhones and Galaxy S devices were not always offered by their respective manufacturer’s stores. Third-party services like WeBuyPhones and Phonetradr offer substantial amounts more than Apple and Samsung for their top of the range devices. WeBuyPhones will buy an iPhone 12 Pro Max from you — provided it has been well-kept — for up to R17,385. At the same time, Phonetradr will offer you R16,885 for a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in good condition. In comparison, iStore will pay up to R15,000 for an iPhone 12 Pro Max, and Samsung will give you R10,000 for a Galaxy S21 Ultra. While iStore will accept trade-ins on devices as old as the original iPhone, we compared more recent models such as the iPhone 11, 12, and 12 Pro Max. We also compared trade-in quotes on the Samsung Galaxy S10, S21, and S21 Ultra. Lastly, for Huawei, we assessed trade-in offers for the P30, P40, and P40 Pro. Phonetradr’s estimations for the Galaxy devices trumped Samsung’s quotes. It is offering up to R5,221 for the Galaxy S10, R10,910 for the S21, and R16,885 for the S21 Ultra — provided the handsets are in good condition. However, it is important to note that Samsung’s R10,000 trade-in discount is guaranteed — so long as you buy a Galaxy S22. Buyers trading in supported smartphones will get the discount if their old device turns on, regardless of its condition otherwise. iStore will give you up to R11,000 for an iPhone 12, which was the highest trade-in estimate we found for the handset. Samsung offers the best trade-in deal for the iPhone 11 at R10,000. When it comes to the top of the range iPhone 12, the Pro Max, WeBuyPhones will give you up to R2,385 more than the iStore. Notably, Samsung and Cellucity offer the best trade-in deals when buying an S22 — and by some margin — on Huawei devices at R10,000 for the P30, P40, and P40 Pro. Phonetradr’s estimates for the Huawei handsets took second place at R4,832, R4,411, and R6,700 for the P30, P40, and P40 Pro, respectively. Cellucity provided the lowest straight trade-in estimates across the board. However, it is a Samsung trade-in partner and offers the same R10,000 promotion when trading in for a Galaxy S22 device. A comparison of estimates from the iStore, Samsung, and several third-party services is provided below. Quotes for each handset are based on the lowest-specced configuration of each smartphone.
