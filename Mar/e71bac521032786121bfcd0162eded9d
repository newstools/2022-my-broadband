Business today demands 100% uptime and a year-on-year reduction in operating costs. This places a lot of pressure on network architects and design engineers who have to continue to innovate and provide robust network solutions that ensure business continuity regardless of loadshedding, riots, flooding and normal network failures. Satellite services are a well-known network option to provide high-reliability, always-on services. However, most architects still hold onto the the old myths, that satellite is expensive, slow and has a latency problem, thus delaying the use of satellite as an elegant solution. Recent developments in satellite technologies and innovative designs of Smart Satellite Services such as Twoobii, bust these myths while offering very attractive network architecture options. Smart Satellite Services bring together the advantages of global high-throughput satellite constellations, leading satellite modem technologies and specialised network engineering to deliver bespoke advantages in business network applications. These advantages typically include sophisticated quality-of-service options; 20Mbps or higher data rates; advanced network options such as layer-2-over-satellite, bespoke billing platforms and operated by specialized service providers. For example, smart satellite services can seamlessly implement a layer-2 back-up option to a network of retail shops which is billed in a “APN-type” pay-per-use model and ensuring connectivity for voice, CCTV and ERP systems. This example will deliver 99,95% uptime to the business at less than 20% of the total network cost. Today, Twoobii is the sole & leading smart satellite service in the African market, operating on the global Intelsat Flex network, with iDirect modem technology and operated by the highly experienced Q-KON niche service provider. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-437286 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Smart-Satelite-Services-QKON.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Smart-Satelite-Services-QKON.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Smart-Satelite-Services-QKON-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Smart-Satelite-Services-QKON-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The below infographic, provides an overview of the functions and features of Smart Satellite Services compared to standard broadband services.
