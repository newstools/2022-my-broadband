You would be hard-pressed to find an international tech stock that has performed well in 2022. Like many other listed companies, tech firms have taken a big hit on the stock market due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February. The conflict has created volatility in global markets, with significant uncertainty around business performance due to sanctions and disruptions in the trade of goods and services. But the decline in stocks started some time before this development. US Market Strategist at Morningstar, Dave Sekera, claimed there were several factors driving investor sentiment and affecting the trading of shares, including: According to Forbes, higher interest rates specifically can lead to businesses amending or pausing plans for growth, which could cause investors to sell assets and take profits. That is particularly true of periods following big returns, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, which spurred tech stock prices. With interest rates at high levels, safer savings instruments such as high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit become more attractive. We’ve assembled a list of five of the best and the worst-performing tech stocks of 2022. The applicable period in our assessment is from markets opening on Monday, 3 January 2022, until the close of the market on Wednesday, 16 March 2022. All the companies included are listed on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. There are very few tech stocks that have climbed in the year-to-date. Intelligence-based cyber defence company Mandiant has been the top performer, with shares surging 28.53% since the start of the year. The company has reported recurring revenue increases, while a $5.4-billion acquisition by Google has helped spur its shares even higher. Another big winner in the past two and half months has been power equipment manufacturer SolarEdge, which has been buoyed by the growing demand for solar products. Its shares rose from $282 to $334 during the period under assessment. Three other tech companies — Jack Henry, Citrix Systems, and FleetCor Technologies — recorded more muted growth. Nevertheless, their performance is impressive considering the prevailing market circumstances. Below are the five best-performing tech shares between 3 January 2022 and 16 March 2022. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437824" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mandiant-new-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="314" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mandiant-new-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mandiant-new--600x236.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mandiant-new--768x301.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437832" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SolarEdge-new-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="314" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SolarEdge-new-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SolarEdge-new--600x236.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SolarEdge-new--768x301.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437822" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jack-Henry-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="314" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jack-Henry-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jack-Henry--600x236.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jack-Henry--768x301.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437818" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Citrix-new-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="314" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Citrix-new-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Citrix-new--600x236.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Citrix-new--768x301.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437820" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FleetCor-new-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="314" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FleetCor-new-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FleetCor-new--600x236.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FleetCor-new--768x301.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> When it comes to the worst-performing tech stocks, several have dropped in value by around 40% or more. Growth-dependent software companies have been among the biggest victims, with Canadian ecommerce tools provider Shopify leading losses. Its shares dropped from $1,363 to $622 for the year-to-date. The company has forecasted that online sales will slow down in 2022 as the movement of people increases due to relaxed lockdown measures. Web and mobile work management platform Asana has also seen a significant decline in its share price, plummeting 48.13% from $72 to $37. Video conferencing company Zoom has similarly struggled to trade anywhere near its October 2020 high of $559 per share. By the close of the market on 16 March, it was trading at $107, 42.02%, down from $184 on 3 January 2022.

While the prices are tumultuous in the current political and economic climate, many investment experts believe they will still generate positive returns in the long run.
