Openview has announced that its viewers will have access to a new channel, eXposed, from 4 April 2022. eXposed will replace eRewind, which Openview will cut from its channel catalogue on 1 April. “As part of some exciting changes and launches in April, the eRewind channel will end on 1 April,” the broadcaster said in a statement. The eRewind channel, which broadcasts what it describes as “golden classics” and “yesteryear TV favourites”, launched on Openview in November 2019. “eXposed launches on 4 April 2022 — promising to entertain and intrigue young (and old). Channel 109 is the channel you’ll want to leave on all day.” The broadcaster said that the new channel would cover a range of genres, including lifestyle, food, music, art, and general entertainment. It will also broadcast certain sitcoms and dramas. Openview said it would also broadcast international Viceland content. eXposed will feature TV shows such as Chasing Famous, States of Undress, F**K That’s Delicious, Most Expensivest by 2 Chainz, and TMZ on TV — to list a few. Openview viewers can tune in to eXposed from 4 April on channel 109.
