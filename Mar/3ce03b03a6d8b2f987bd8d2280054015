Vodacom has launched Africa’s first Amazon Web Services (AWS) Outposts Innovation Lab in collaboration with AWS and Intel. The laboratory will focus on accelerating technology innovations across different industries, delivering faster scalability, and creating the opportunity to use infrastructure and technologies to solve business challenges. It is expected to help enterprise and public sector customers of Vodacom Business to accelerate their digital transformation. Located in Johannesburg, the lab will serve as a proof of concept setup for customers to test their applications and environment for performance on AWS Outposts. “Intel-powered AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that is designed to provide AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to virtually any on-premises or edge location,” Vodacom said. “It enables the running of applications that have low latency, data residency, and local data processing needs on premises, while reducing the time, resources, and operational risk required to procure, manage, and upgrade on-premises infrastructure.” AWS Outposts is powered by Intel Xeon Scalable processors and offer the same Amazon EC2 infrastructure-as-a-service on the edge as in the cloud. “With consistent, low-latency edge infrastructure, your on-premises applications running on AWS Outposts can be seamlessly migrated to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and back and therefore, allow you to place your workloads securely where they perform the best — from edge to cloud.” Intel is working with AWS to promote the laboratory’s offering and Vodacom leverages its position as an APN member to test and deliver the migration to AWS Outposts.
