SAP is hosting a virtual roundtable webinar that will focus on the latest trends and innovations in human resource management. Changes to HR trends have been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced governments across the world to reorganise their resources to align with the new world of work. This has included a shift in how human resources must be managed by state departments, and has required governments to adopt modern technology and tools to provide a better working experience for state employees. SAP’s goal with this webinar is to highlight how the latest technologies can help government departments improve their human resource management systems. This includes a focus on improving workforce management in a world of hybrid working, managing the candidate experience when acquiring and retaining key talent, as well as upskilling, reskilling, and future-skilling employees for the new work environments ahead. The webinar will take place at 09:00 on 12 April 2022 and is a must-attend if you are involved in HR within the public sector.
