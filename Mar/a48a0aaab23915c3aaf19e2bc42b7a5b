Telkom is still at the forefront as a leading device, data and internet provider in South Africa, securing their corner in the market. With the kickoff of Telkom’s Monate Mondays campaign in October 2021, the service provider saw fit to support customers’ connectivity needs with affordable devices and data deals. The campaign rolls out device deals every Monday, only on Monday, at discounted prices. This has undoubtably been one of the best ways to showcase Telkom’s offerings, particularly internet-enabled devices at more affordable prices. The service provider continues to prove why they are a top choice for convenience, a popular network provider, and the largest provider in subscriber base in the country.
