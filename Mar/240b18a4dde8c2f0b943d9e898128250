Intel has announced its Core i9-12900KS Processor will release worldwide on 5 April at a recommended price of $729 (R10,582, excl. taxes). The new CPU will boast up to 5.5 GHz max turbo frequency and Intel Adaptive Boost Technology, which Intel says will provide the best possible performance for gaming. “Based on Intel’s 12th Gen performance hybrid architecture, this processor can hit 5.5 GHz on up to two cores for the first time, giving the most extreme gamers the ability to maximise performance,” said Intel’s gaming, creator, and esports segment head Marcus Kennedy. The CPU will reportedly have 16 cores (8 Performance and 8 Efficient), 24 threads, 150W base power and a 30MB Intel Smart Cache. Despite these improvements, the new CPU will still be compatible with existing Z690 motherboards and support DDR5 4800 MT/s and DDR4 3200 MT/s. Intel has stated that this will allow gamers and those who prefer to overclock their PCs to take their performance “to the next level”. The Intel Core i9-12900KS will be available as a boxed processor and integrated into Intel’s channel and OEM partner’s systems.
