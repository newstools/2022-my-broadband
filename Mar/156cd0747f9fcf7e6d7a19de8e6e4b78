Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in eastern Ukraine came under attack from Russian shelling early Friday, Ukrainian officials said, raising the stakes in Vladimir Putin’s invasion as his forces bombarded cities across the nation. Emergency services said a fire that broke out in a training complex at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been extinguished and there were no injuries. Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency the blaze had “not affected ‘essential’ equipment,” and that there had been no change reported in radiation levels. Reactors are “being protected by robust containment structures” and are being safely shut down, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement, adding her department had activated its nuclear incident response team. President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as reports emerged about the attack, and the leaders called on Russia “to cease its military activities in the area and to allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” according to a White House statement. “Europe must wake up,” Zelenskiy said in a video message early Friday. “Russian tanks are firing at the nuclear power station, the biggest one in Europe.” He also spoke with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other leaders. “If there is an explosion, it is the end of Europe,” Zelenskiy added. “Only urgent Europe actions can stop Russian troops.” A missile had hit the nuclear plant’s unit no. 1 and the government is seeking more clarity on any damage at the site, Ukraine energy minister Herman Halushchenko said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. He called for outside support to help close air space over the country’s reactors. NATO has previously made clear it would not set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine as it would bring the alliance’s aircraft into direct confrontation with Russia. Mariano Grossi, the IAEA’s director general, spoke with Ukrainian authorities and warned of “severe danger” if its reactors were hit. The site accounts for about 20% of the country’s electricity, according to its website. Concerns over an immediate disaster were eased as authorities confirmed the status and location of the fire within the Zaporizhzhia site and that radiation levels were normal. Knee-jerk losses in equity markets moderated as traders assessed the severity of the situation at the facility. S&P 500 Index futures were trading 0.9% lower, after earlier falling 1.7%. Gold pared earlier gains as demand for haven assets eased. Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone! — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 4, 2022 The fact fire had posed no immediate risk to reactors “does not in any way excuse the Russian troops for firing on this nuclear power plant facility and endangering not only Ukraine and the surrounding countries, but really Russia itself should there be some kind of explosion,” Rose Gottemoeller, a former NATO deputy secretary general, told Bloomberg Television in an interview. “It’s one of those fratricidal situations that nobody, not even Vladimir Putin, should wish for.” The Zaporizhzhia power plant in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar is home to six Soviet-designed 950-megawatt reactors built between 1984 and 1995, with capacity of 5.7 gigawatts, enough to power more than 4 million homes. Phone calls to the power plant didn’t connect, and plant officials didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the situation. In the days leading up to the strike, the International Atomic Energy Agency had called for a 30-kilometer exclusion zone surrounding all of Ukraine’s reactors, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of combat taking place in and around the facilities. There’s never before been a military attack on an operating nuclear plant, analysts said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-436216" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ukraine-power-plant-map_Bloomberg.jpg" alt="" width="814" height="697" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ukraine-power-plant-map_Bloomberg.jpg 814w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ukraine-power-plant-map_Bloomberg-467x400.jpg 467w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ukraine-power-plant-map_Bloomberg-622x533.jpg 622w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ukraine-power-plant-map_Bloomberg-768x658.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
