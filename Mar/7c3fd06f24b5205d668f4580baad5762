Business data volumes continue to rise, making data security one of the most important consideration for a business in the wake of the many data breaches reported on in the news almost weekly.

Thankfully, there is one suite of data security solutions that stands above all others: IBM Guardium. Guardium leverages IBM’s dominance in technology innovation to offer the most comprehensive and intelligent data security solutions on the market. Through Guardium, the entire data security lifecycle can be monitored and protected seamlessly and automatically – from data discovery and classification, data activity monitoring of suspicious behaviour based on risk to data assets, encryption and zero-trust based defensive enforcement actions such as blocking. “Blocking connections to your most sensitive data assets can be set up rapidly and quite seamlessly, before you and your IT teams have even set foot in the office,” said Craig Botha, IBM Business Development Manager for Advanced Technologies at Axiz.
