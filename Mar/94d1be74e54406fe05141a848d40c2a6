Gold has outperformed Bitcoin and the S&P 500 by over 5% this year. Gold is one of the oldest forms of currency known to man. Bartering with beads and seashells seems primitive now, and the modern investor may be looking at gold, an age-old commodity, with scepticism. Surely there are new and more contemporary ways to secure your wealth? Of course, there are more options available nowadays but the facts cannot be denied: investing in gold is still as valuable to the modern investor as it was to the prehistoric man. Author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” and financial guru in his own right, Robert Kiyosaki said, “Commodities such as gold and silver have a world market that transcends national borders, politics, religions, and race.” Before there was a push towards cryptocurrencies or decentralised finance (DeFi), gold was the currency that transcended financial boundaries. The current conflict between Russia and Ukraine has shaken the world and financial markets. Not only for crypto, the Russian ruble (Russia’s national currency) has fallen to record lows. Even seasoned investors are keeping a wary eye on the news. If a new, all-engulfing war wasn’t enough inflation has been surging around the world. Inflation is the silent wealth killer that may pose a bigger hazard to your investments than a war in the long term. These may be unpredictable times but there is a way to safeguard yourself and that is through gold and other safe-haven assets. Throughout history, few investments have rivalled gold in popularity as a hedge against almost any kind of trouble, from inflation and economic upheaval to currency fluctuations and war. Simply put, gold has historically been seen by investors as the “go-to” in terms of safe-haven assets. Safe-havens are investments that maintain or increase in value during times of market uncertainty. Even during turbulent times in the world, these assets hold strong and provide the security your portfolio needs to weather the storm. Gold is one of the most favoured choices because of its proven credentials as a wealth protector over its centuries of use. Even though a worst-case scenario currently, war is not a new concept to gold investments. Considering how many wars it has survived and the fact that it still remains a top commodity proves gold is a solid choice. But wars and pandemics are not the only things gold offers you gilded protection from. There is a big threat to your wealth that increases silently every year — inflation. And war may only be worsening the situation. You have most likely heard a similar story from a family member, “When I was younger I could buy a bag of chips, three loaves of bread and a case of drinks all for 50c. Plus I would still get change.” While it may sound far-fetched, there is truth in this tall tale. The cost of just about everything is higher nowadays because of inflation. Inflation is the rate at which the price of goods and services increases over time. Most people don’t pay too much attention to inflation and accept it as a consequence of life. But smart money knows that if you aren’t keeping ahead of inflation, you’re stunting your wealth’s growth potential. In South Africa, your money is currently buying you -5.7% less than it did a year ago. What this means is that your wealth is eroding every year you decide to hold cash over an investment. “I know -5.7% inflation doesn’t sound like a lot, but if that rate continues for 10 years, people would have lost roughly -44% of their buying power. Looking at that number, it’s easy to see why it is becoming more and more important for people to protect their wealth in times of inflation. They can do this by picking the right investments,” says Chris Beamish, Investment Analyst at crypto Investment platform, Revix. Throughout history, investors have looked to protect their wealth in times of inflation by buying assets that will either keep up with inflation or beat it. Certain assets such as stocks and housing are known as “inflation hedges” and offer protection against the rising tide. But it’s gold that holds the longest and most successful track record in beating inflation. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-436218" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/PAXG_Graph1.png" alt="" width="640" height="396" /> As you can see above, investing in gold has been a great way to make sure your money retains or increases its purchasing power over time. Gold has outpaced inflation by +47% over the last 5 years – this means that instead of life becoming seemingly more expensive, life actually became +47% cheaper for you. Institutional investors have at least 1%-5% allocation to gold and other precious metals. These are the smartest minds in the investment world, so you have to ask yourself why? The reason is simple: no one, not even Robert Kiyosaki, knows what will happen tomorrow. You should be preparing for all possible outcomes. One way to do this is by holding a well-diversified bundle of assets that accounts for multiple outcomes. This is what the best in the world do and it works. While gold may be a centuries-old currency, the benefits it offers have no expiry date.
