Many of South Africa’s big Internet service providers (ISPs) are recruiting developers and engineers in various roles. According to the Skills Development Corporation, the most employable field at the end of 2021 was information technology, including software development, IT infrastructure management, and web design. Michael Page’s Salary Guide and Hiring Insights report for 2022 revealed that the top five most in-demand skills in South Africa are in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, software development, and cybersecurity. At their core, ISPs are technology companies that rely heavily on their ability to develop innovative services that can capture market share and keep customers happy. With South Africans having hundreds of ISPs to choose from, the ability to solve problems quickly is paramount. To stay competitive, ISPs must employ a workforce of tech-savvy individuals who can develop and maintain systems that set them apart from the rest of the pack. We assembled the current vacancies at some of South Africa’s most prominent ISPs. These companies offered opportunities in several technology disciplines — from software developers and engineers to project managers and advanced technical support.
