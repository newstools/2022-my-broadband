The South African government plans to lift the state of disaster by 5 April 2022, cooperative governance and traditional affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, said during a press conference on Tuesday. As part of the transition out of the state of disaster, the minister published new regulations intended to remain in effect 30 days after the end of the state of disaster. Dlamini-Zuma said these regulations were necessary to prevent a “reckless and abrupt” move away from the state of disaster. The regulations are open for public comment for 48 hours — until 17:00 on 1 April 2022. The government will consider feedback before finalising and gazetting the regulations. It is hoped that President Cyril Ramaphosa will then address the nation on lifting the state of disaster by Tuesday, 5 April 2022. It should be noted that these regulations are separate from the health department’s proposed amendments to the National Health Act, which are open to comment until 16 April 2022. Other government departments will likely propose regulatory changes in the coming weeks to help deal with Covid-19 within specific industries. The table below details the proposed temporary regulations envisioned for the 30-day transition period following the lifting of the state of disaster. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
