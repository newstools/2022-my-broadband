Openview has announced that it will cut the eNews & Sport Channel from its catalogue, with effect from midnight. This follows a report from TV journalist Thinus Ferreira last month that staff at the channel were handed retrenchment notices as it was no longer viable. The cutting of eNews & Sports came with little warning, and Openview said that Premier League games and other selected sports would be available on the eReality channel. The satellite television provider previously announced that it would be cutting the eRewind channel to replace it with eXposed. eRewind will also be unavailable on Openserve’s platform from tonight. “As part of some exciting changes and launches in April, the eRewind channel will end on 1 April,” the broadcaster said. The eRewind channel, which broadcast “golden classics” and “yesteryear TV favourites”, made it onto Openview’s channel list in November 2019. Openview will be adding new channels to its catalogue soon. The first is eXposed (channel 109) — a food, music, art, and entertainment channel — which will be available from Monday, 4 April 2022. “The channel features content that will not only push boundaries but go beyond conventional television while sparking inclusive conversations entertainingly,” Openview said in a statement. eXposed will broadcast TV shows such as Chasing Famous, States of Undress, F**K That’s Delicious, Most Expensivest by 2 Chainz, and TMZ on TV.
