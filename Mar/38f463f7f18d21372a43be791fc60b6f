Tesla Inc. raised prices on all its vehicles after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said costs were increasing at the companies he runs. The cheapest Model 3 in the US is now $46,990 (R710,000 excl. import costs and taxes), according to Tesla’s website. The company raised prices by 3% to 5% in both the US and China, Dan Levy, a Credit Suisse analyst, said in a note to clients. Musk tweeted earlier this week that both Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. were seeing “significant” inflation in raw materials and logistics. The electric car and rocket-making companies aren’t alone. The S&P GSCI Index — a commodity market benchmark — surged 20% the first five days of the month, the biggest weekly gain going back to 1970.
