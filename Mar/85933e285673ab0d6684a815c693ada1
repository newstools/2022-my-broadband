We’re all feeling the belt-tightening effects of the recession in South Africa. Covid was not kind to our economy or our bank accounts. At the same time, inflation decreases the value of our money faster than annual salary increases. Read more about how inflation is the silent wealth killer here. Gone are the days of your savings account giving you interest that can meet your current needs, let alone your future needs. In most cases, your savings interest won’t even cover your bank fees. As things get tighter, finding higher returns on your savings is essential. Regularly putting money away is an important habit, but what if your savings could be earning more interest than if it were just sitting in a bank? What if you could invest your hard-earned rands and watch them turn into the wealth you need for the future? We live in an age of innovation, with technology constantly changing the world around us. With innovation and change come life-changing opportunities. Think for a moment about the last time you went to Blockbuster to rent a DVD. Remember how popular Musica and Look & Listen were? Broadband and the internet changed an entire industry in a few years. Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify are commonplace today, but a revolution happened right under our noses. Streaming replaced DVD rentals because it was more convenient and cheaper, with more choice for you. Imagine you had invested in Netflix before it went mainstream or Apple before it launched the iPhone. Now imagine an innovation that will change the way we bank forever. One that offers the same level of cost-saving and convenience as Netflix or the iPhone. This is the scale of opportunity that investing in DeFi offers. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-438768" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bank-rates-vs-DeFi-rates-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="292" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bank-rates-vs-DeFi-rates-1.png 741w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bank-rates-vs-DeFi-rates-1-600x274.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> DeFi (Decentralised Finance) is the rapidly growing sector of personal finance products built on blockchains using cryptocurrencies. It replaces the functions of traditional financial institutions like banks (the interest on your savings and the loans you need) with none of the frustrations of using a bank. What if we told you that you could earn 10% interest on a savings account? What about taking out a loan without a credit history, with the lowest rates on the market? DeFi makes this all possible without the high fees that banks charge. The key is replacing outdated systems with advanced programs called Smart Contracts built to perform specific tasks, allowing you to manage your money at speed and without error. Thanks to blockchain innovation, DeFi is secure and available to anyone with an internet connection. While DeFi networks are already managing over $200Bn, we are still early in the technology adoption phase. It’s complicated to use and you need to know what you’re doing, but this won’t be the case for long. Companies like Revix (a Cape Town-based investment platform backed by JSE listed Sabvest) are building easy to use, and customer-friendly apps. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-438770" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Returns.png" alt="" width="640" height="292" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Returns.png 1112w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Returns-600x274.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Returns-800x365.png 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Returns-768x350.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Early adopters enjoy the benefits and high gains — you can too. In 2021, the top 10 DeFi Bundle saw 137% growth. If you’re looking for a wise, early investment with the potential of high returns, DeFi is for you. The smart play is to buy the digital tokens used to facilitate loans and interest on the leading DeFi platforms. It’s a lot like buying property off-plan in a great neighbourhood.

It takes advantage of opportunities available from the most reputable DeFi cryptocurrencies through buying or selling each asset. This dynamic and fully automated approach makes investing effortless, maximising your returns and saving you time. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-438802" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Crypto-Bundle2.png" alt="" width="640" height="165" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Crypto-Bundle2.png 1456w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Crypto-Bundle2-600x155.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Crypto-Bundle2-800x207.png 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Crypto-Bundle2-768x198.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeFi-Crypto-Bundle2-1200x310.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Invest in the Revix DeFi Top 10 Bundle between the 25th and 7th of April and you won’t be charged any buy-in fees.
