Kulula and British Airways are resuming flights on Thursday after the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) reinstated Comair’s Air Operator’s Certificate. SACAA suspended Comair’s certificate on Saturday, 12 March 2022, resulting in the grounding of all Kulula and British Airways flights for five days. The authority said that the airlines’ experienced concerning occurrences ranging from engine failures, engine malfunction, and landing gear malfunctions in the past month. Initially, the suspension was precautionary and only intended to last 24 hours. But the following day, SACAA suspended the certificate indefinitely to assess further evidence from Comair that it had met the necessary safety requirements. The suspension led to travellers with bookings getting stranded while ticket prices on alternative airlines surged due to 40% less domestic flying capacity. Comair CEO Glenn Orsmond said the operator had put in an immense effort over the last five days and nights to engage and work with the SACAA to restore its licence. “Our focus is now to get our operations back to normal as quickly as possible so we can further assist our customers,” said Orsmond. Comair explained the SACAA findings concerned the level of evidential support of some management systems and procedures relating to quality assurance processes, the structuring and personnel in the safety department and documentation flow regarding repair confirmations. “No safety and security findings were made regarding either flight operations or maintenance,” Comair stated. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-437188" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kulula-parked-aircraft-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kulula-parked-aircraft.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kulula-parked-aircraft-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kulula-parked-aircraft-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The airlines’ schedules will be restored in a phased manner, and customers were advised to check them on the airlines’ websites before coming to the airport.
