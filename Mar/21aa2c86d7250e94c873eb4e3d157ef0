Sony has announced that it is revamping its membership services — PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now — by merging them into one subscription. The new service, also known as PlayStation Plus, will be available from June 2022 in three tiers, namely Essential, Extra, and Premium. The Essential subscription will cost $9.99 (R145) a month — the same as the current PlayStation Plus plan — and allows users two monthly downloadable games, exclusive discounts, cloud storage for saved games, and online multiplayer access. Providing all the benefits of the Essential plan, PlayStation Plus’ Extra subscription will be available for $14.99 (R218) per month and adds a catalogue of up to 400 games that subscribers can download. PlayStation Plus Premium features an additional 340 games — including original PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PSP games — and offers time-limited game trials to subscribers. The plan costs $17.99 (R262) a month. Sony will also launch a PlayStation Plus Deluxe subscription in select markets that don’t have access to cloud streaming. The company said its Deluxe plan would be a discounted version of PlayStation’s Premium subscription. It offers similar content to the Premium subscription, bar the cloud streaming titles, and pricing will vary by market. Sony stated that upon launch, the standalone PlayStation Now subscription would no longer be available. “PlayStation Now customers will migrate over to PlayStation Plus Premium with no increase to their current subscription fees at launch,” it added. The revamped subscription will begin its phased rollout in June by launching in several markets in Asia, followed by North America, Europe, and the rest of the world where PlayStation Plus is available. Sony has not announced South African pricing as of yet. MyBroadband understands that South Africa would be included in the PlayStation Plus Deluxe category, but pricing is yet to be finalised.
