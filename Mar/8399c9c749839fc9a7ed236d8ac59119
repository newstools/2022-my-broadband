President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the set of Netflix’s live-action anime series One Piece on Thursday, which is filming on location at Cape Town Film Studios. One Piece is Netflix’s biggest production project in Africa to date in terms of scale and budget, covering South African labour, infrastructure, and suppliers, the Presidency said in a statement. The production involves more than 50 South African cast members, over 1,000 crew member jobs, and an Academy of Creative Excellence mentorship programme for more than 30 young creatives and technicians in collaboration with the SA Film Academy. The Presidency said that Cape Town Film Studios represents an investment of over R1 billion since 2010 to create a state-of-the-art film studio complex. “The studios are the premiere film production destination in the southern hemisphere.” It said the complex had enabled over 100 productions, with a collective budget of over US$2 billion (R29.8 billion). “Cape Town Film Studios has been the catalyst over the past 12 years for the Western Cape to benefit from the significant multiplier offered by the film industry, generating an estimated R7 billion per year and totalling more than R100 billion to the region over this period,” said the Presidency. “Similar facilities are envisaged with the development of eThekwini Film City in Durban later this year.” Photos of the visit are embedded below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437862" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-8.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-8.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-8-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-8-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437860" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-7.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-7.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-7-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-7-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437858" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-6.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-6.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-6-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-6-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437856" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-5.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-5.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-5-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-5-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437852" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-3.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437850" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-2.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Netflix-One-Piece-Cyril-Ramaphosa-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
