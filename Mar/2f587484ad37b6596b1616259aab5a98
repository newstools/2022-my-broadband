Huawei has launched its P50 Pro flagship smartphone in South Africa. The local rollout comes after the company also made the smartphone available other international markets outside of China. The P50 series was first launched exclusively in China in August 2021, the first of Huawei’s P-series flagships in a while that was not available elsewhere from the get-go. Huawei South Africa CTO Ahkram Moham previously told MyBroadband the delay in other markets was due to the global chip shortage, but confirmed the smartphone would be coming to the country. It is the first Huawei smartphone flagship to land in the country after the Mate 40 series. The P50 Pro features a 6.6-inch OLED display that boasts a 2,700 x 1,228 resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate, basically par for the course when it comes to flagships. The phone’s Dual-Matrix Camera Design will make it instantly recognisable when viewed from the rear, with two large circular windows for the cameras. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-431842" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P50-Pro-camera.png" alt="" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P50-Pro-camera.png 1548w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P50-Pro-camera-579x400.png 579w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P50-Pro-camera-623x430.png 623w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P50-Pro-camera-768x530.png 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P50-Pro-camera-1536x1061.png 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P50-Pro-camera-1200x829.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> For fast performance, the P50 Pro boasts Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 4G chip. Storage options are available in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. The former two come with 8GB RAM, while the latter can be configured with up to 12GB. The storage is also expandable using a Nano Memory card, if you are willing to give up one of the SIM slots. Users can expect a full day of use between charges thanks to its 4,360mAh battery pack. When the juice does run out, you can charge it up quickly via 66W wired charging, which can fill the battery from 0-70% in 30 minutes. Perhaps more notably, the P50 Pro supports 50W wireless charging, which is lightning-fast when compared to the maximum 15W provided by Qi or MagSafe wireless charging. But the P50 Pro’s standout feature is its camera. Despite issues with sourcing hardware, Huawei has not lost its touch in this department. The phone has received rave reviews for its photographic capabilities, thanks to the Leica-powered quad rear camera comes with a 50MP main lens, 13MP ultrawide shooter, 64MP periscope telephoto lens, and 40MP monochrome sensor. This system currently places the P50 Pro 2nd on DxOMark’s smartphone camera ratings. With a score of 144, it outperformed other heavyweights such as the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra and iPhone 13 Pro Max. For big selfie-takers, there is a 13MP ultrawide camera with 100-degree viewing angle. The P50 Pro will be available for pre-order in South Africa on the Huawei Online Store from 22 March 2022 with a starting price of R19,999. The smartphone will be generally available from participating retailers on 1 April 2022. Huawei is offering several promotions for pre-orders, including up to R2,999 off when paying a R199 deposit, and free gifts valued at R8,998. It will be offered in two colours — cocoa gold and golden black.
