A 20-year-old Ukrainian refugee has explained how cryptocurrency helped him flee his country and pay his living expenses as a refugee in neighbouring Poland. CNBC reports that the refugee, who goes by the pseudonym “Fadey”, could get out of the country faster because he had Bitcoin. On the morning of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, many residents were desperately queuing to withdraw cash from ATMs that they could take to a country of refuge. Instead of waiting in line, Fadey made a peer-to-peer exchange to a friend, trading $600 (R8,725) worth of his Bitcoin savings for the Polish national currency zloty. He used this to pay for tickets on a bus across the border and accommodation in a hostel for himself and his girlfriend. He also took his USB drive along, which held the private key to his crypto wallet, which contained another $2,000 (R29,067) in Bitcoin. This money has been essential in funding his living expenses outside Ukraine. Cryptocurrencies have played a significant role in bringing relief to Ukraine’s defensive and humanitarian efforts. During the early days of the conflict, Ukraine officials posted the addresses of two crypto wallets on their Twitter accounts. According to The National News, the wallets had amassed about $10.2 million (R148.24 million) in cryptocurrency in just four days. The crypto donations had grown to more than $100 million (R1.45 billion) by 20 March 2022. Michael Chobanian, the founder of the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna, said the money is being spent on daily rations, bulletproof vests, and helmets. Cryptocurrency transfers allow users to make individual donations without going through an organisation, meaning they can be completed quickly. Chobanian said that cryptocurrencies are also less influenced by macroeconomic factors and geopolitics, pointing to the depreciation of the value of the Ukrainian hryvnia.
