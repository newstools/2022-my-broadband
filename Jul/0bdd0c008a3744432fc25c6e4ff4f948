Eskom has provided an update on the stages of load-shedding it plans to implement for the rest of the week and over the coming weekend. The state-owned power utility said it would implement stage 2 during the evenings from Monday until Thursday between 16:00 and midnight. The schedule for these four days is confirmed, Eskom said. From Friday, 22 July 2022, and into next week Monday, 25 July 2022, it will downgrade load-shedding to stage 1 during the same peak periods. The load-shedding schedule for the week is summarised below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-453014" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/18-July-2022-load-shedding.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="417" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/18-July-2022-load-shedding.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/18-July-2022-load-shedding-600x313.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/18-July-2022-load-shedding-768x400.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Last week, Eskom chief operating officer Jan Oberholzer said the utility aimed to suspend load-shedding ten days from Monday, 11 July 2022. The current plan will see Eskom overshoot that target by four days. It will also mean that load-shedding would have been implemented every day for five consecutive weeks. MyBroadband recently analysed the amount of load-shedding implemented in 2022 using data from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and popular load-shedding app EskomSePush. We found that the severity of load-shedding between January and the first week of July 2022 was already worse than in the entire 2021 — which was the worst year of load-shedding on record.
