Meta Platforms Inc. is introducing music revenue sharing on Facebook to help creators make money from videos that use licensed music, in an effort to better compete with rival TikTok. A new tool called Rights Manager, developed by Meta through partnerships across the music industry, will also help content owners protect their rights. Video creators will receive 20% of revenue on eligible videos, with a separate share going to music rights holders and to Meta, the company said in a statement on Monday. Videos must be at least 60 seconds long and there must be a visual component as well. The licensed music itself can’t be the primary purpose. The feature started rolling out Monday to video creators globally. Eligible videos will earn money with in-stream ads delivered in the US initially, and that will expand to the rest of the world where music is available on Facebook in the coming months.
