Eskom has updated its planned load-shedding schedule for the coming weekend. One of the changes from its announcement earlier this week is that it will implement stage 2 instead of stage 1 load-shedding on Friday evening between 16:00 and midnight. The state-owned power utility also said load-shedding during the evening peak is confirmed until at least Saturday. It promised to communicate whether load-shedding would be required after that over the weekend. A table provided alongside Eskom’s latest load-shedding schedule update shows the utility has pre-emptively kept stage 1 load-shedding for Sunday evening between 16:00 and midnight. The stages confirmed in the coming days are as follows: Below is the revised timetable showing Eskom’s new load-shedding schedule for Friday and over the weekend. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-453486 size-large" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-table-new-800x369.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="369" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-table-new-800x369.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-table-new-600x276.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-table-new-768x354.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eskom-table-new.jpg 1072w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
