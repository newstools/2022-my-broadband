Bitcoin sank to a one-week low on Tuesday, buffeted by nervousness ahead of a looming Federal Reserve interest-rate hike and amid harsher regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency sector. The largest token dropped as much as 5.4% on Tuesday in Asia and was trading at $21,073 as of 9:42 a.m. in Singapore. The MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 gauge shed more than 4%. The retreat has put a dent in hopes for a sustained Bitcoin rebound and returned the token to a trading range between roughly $19,000 and $22,000. Risk appetite is generally on the back foot before an expected 75 basis-point Fed rate rise Wednesday, part of a tightening cycle that’s sapping liquidity. “We’ve had some stabilization over the past few weeks and that gave some folks confidence that perhaps a bottom was being put in place,” Katie Stockton, co-founder of Fairlead Strategies, said on Bloomberg Television. “We’re not so convinced.” Rising interest rates and high-profile meltdowns like that of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital have pummeled digital tokens this year. Bitcoin is down 55% over the period. The turmoil is leading to ever greater regulatory oversight of the industry. Coinbase Global Inc., for instance, is facing a US probe into whether it improperly let Americans trade digital assets that should have been registered as securities, according to three people familiar with the matter. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-453990" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BTC-ZAR-price-Luno-2022-07-26.jpg" alt="" width="1687" height="842" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BTC-ZAR-price-Luno-2022-07-26.jpg 1687w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BTC-ZAR-price-Luno-2022-07-26-600x299.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BTC-ZAR-price-Luno-2022-07-26-800x399.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BTC-ZAR-price-Luno-2022-07-26-768x383.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BTC-ZAR-price-Luno-2022-07-26-1536x767.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BTC-ZAR-price-Luno-2022-07-26-1200x599.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />
