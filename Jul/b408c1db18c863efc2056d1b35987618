Samsung sold almost 10 million foldable smartphones worldwide in 2021, the company’s president for mobile, TM Roh, has revealed. In a blog post on Thursday, Roh said that while Samsung’s Galaxy Z foldables were initially described as “radical”, they had become much more commonplace in recent years. “It became clear that this ground-breaking, flexible design fit perfectly into modern lifestyles,” Roh said. “As a result, what was once a novelty three years ago, is now the preferred choice for millions.” “We are reaching the moment where these foldable devices are becoming widespread and staking a bigger claim in the overall smartphone market.” Roh said the nearly 10 million Samsung foldables sold last year was 300% more than in 2020, or a four-fold increase. “I predict this fast-paced growth will continue,” he stated. The news of Samsung’s impressive foldable sales comes amid reports that the company is focusing on making its foldable line-up its new flagship contender to the Apple iPhone. For the first time in over a decade, Samsung’s Galaxy S series will reportedly take a backseat. Samsung offers two foldable smartphone models — the Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold. While several other manufacturers — including Huawei and Motorola — offer foldable smartphone displays, the South Korean tech giant has had the biggest success in this department. Roh said of the foldables Samsung has sold, 70% were the clamshell-style Flip model, while the remaining 30% were the booklet-style Fold. The company is expected to unveil the fourth generation of these two foldables during its Galaxy Unpacked event on 10 August 2022.
