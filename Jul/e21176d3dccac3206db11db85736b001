They detailed the numerous intelligent data management services that Commvault provides through its flexible delivery model. This includes: These services are available on the cloud and on-premises, and can be used for workloads such as SaaS, devices, databases, VMs, and containers.

Another major benefit of Metallic is that it helps businesses of all sizes to implement proactive cyber protection – and Mollett used ThreatWise was a great example of this. ThreatWise is a Metallic product that mimics your data assets to lure attackers into a trap. These attackers think they have access to your business systems, but are instead isolated in a fake replica. This protects businesses from attacks that would otherwise be extremely costly. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-453864 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Commvault-Picture-3.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="323" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Commvault-Picture-3.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Commvault-Picture-3-600x303.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The event made it clear that Commvault’s solutions are suitable for any type of business and all of its workloads. “If you are looking for a solution that can protect all the complexities of your ecosystem and can leverage your data in meaningful ways, then Commvault is your solution,” said Mollett. “We leave no workload behind.
