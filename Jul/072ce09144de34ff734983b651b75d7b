Axis Communications, a global leader in network video and surveillance products, held its Annual Partner Awards at the Venue, Green Point in Sandton on 1 July 2022. The event aims to celebrate and acknowledge the efforts of Axis’ partners by awarding them for key projects and achievements throughout the year. After not being able to host partners at an event of this nature for the past two years due to Covid, Axis was pleased to be able to share this prestigious event in person with its partners. “We were thrilled and privileged to receive the award for South Africa Distributor of the Year – 2021.” This is a huge honour and is indicative of the hard work our team has put into promoting and supporting the Axis brand since becoming an Axis distributor,” says Graham Duxbury, founder and CEO of Duxbury Networking. The award was presented by Lee-Ross Duimpies, Key Account Manager at Axis Communications, who said “With Duxbury’s extensive solutions offering they provide, they are an excellent fit to Axis’ open application platform for software-based solutions.” “Duxbury strives to develop excellent relationships with its partners who view them as dependable trusted advisors.
