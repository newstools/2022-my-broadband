South Africans in the market for a comfortable gaming chair have many options that won’t break the bank. While building a powerful PC is where gamers spend most of their money, an uncomfortable chair could easily cut your gaming session short. When shopping for a gaming chair, it is crucial to consider its maximum weight capacity, the material used for the frame and base, the class of gas cylinder, and the seat material. Regarding the frame and base material, steel or metal alloys are more durable than other materials. Gaming chairs use gas cylinders to allow height adjustability, which falls into four classes. You should opt for a chair with a class 4 gas cylinder over one with a lower rating since class 4 supports the most weight and is more durable than class 2 or 3 cylinders. Most gaming chairs on the market use types of synthetic leather, like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane (PU) leather, which typically tears easier than the real thing. However, synthetic leather is more sun-resistant and breathable than its animal-based counterpart. While gaming chairs might seem attractive if you are on a budget, the general consensus is that office chairs are a superior long-term investment. We browsed Takealot, Incredible Connection, Wootware, Progenix, and Evetech for the best gaming chairs under R5,000. <img class="size-full wp-image-451446 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cooler-Master-R1S-gaming-chair.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cooler-Master-R1S-gaming-chair.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cooler-Master-R1S-gaming-chair-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cooler-Master-R1S-gaming-chair-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cooler Master’s Caliber R1S chair features PU synthetic leather.
