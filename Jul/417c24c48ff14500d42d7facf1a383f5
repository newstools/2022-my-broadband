Pick n Pay has almost doubled its online sales between 28 February and 3 July 2022. In a trading update released Tuesday for the first 18 weeks of its financial year, the retailer reported 97.3% growth in online sales. This includes scheduled delivery, click and collect, and its on-demand delivery online shopping service “asap!”. Group sales over the period increased 10.7%. “Progress towards our goal of a step-change increase in online sales continues,” Pick n Pay reported. “The launch of a dedicated Pick n Pay food and grocery offer on the Mr D App is on track.” On 17 May, Pick n Pay and Takealot announced they had concluded an agreement to add the retailer’s food, groceries, and liquor products to the Mr D app. A dedicated section for Pick n Pay will be added to the Mr D app in August 2022, with national coverage targeted by the company’s financial year-end. Pick n Pay CEO Pieter Boone said shoppers will have access to products stocked by local stores and would earn Smart Shopper points for purchases. Dedicated staff will pick up items in-store after customers place their orders, and Takealot’s fleet will deliver them. The partnership comes as competition heats up between South Africa’s largest food retailers in rapid on-demand delivery, including Checkers Sixty60 and Woolies Dash. Woolworths also published a trading update for the 52 weeks ended 26 June 2022, reporting 45.2% growth in Woolworths Food online sales in South Africa. The company said the growth was driven by the continued rollout of its on-demand online offering and contributed 3.2% of South African sales. Overall, Woolworths’ online sales grew by 13.2% and contributed 4.4% to South African sales.
