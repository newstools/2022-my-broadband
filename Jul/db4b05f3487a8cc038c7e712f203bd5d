EskomSePush (ESP) is testing a new feature that will make it easier for users to see when their chosen areas are getting load-shedding over several days. ESP co-founder Herman Maritz posted a screenshot of the new “Upcoming load-shedding” window in the iOS app on Twitter on Friday morning. Maritz told MyBroadband that the feature had been a priority for some time. However, Eskom’s recent shift to implementing different stages of load-shedding during the day meant the ESP user interface first had to be adapted. In the past, Eskom mainly stuck to one stage of load-shedding over multiple days or only used a single stage for a limited time, like during the evening peak demand hours. But on several occasions in the past few weeks, it would implement different combinations of stages — such as Stage 4, Stage 6, and Stage 2 — within the same 24-hour cycle. ESP has tried to assist by posting Eskom’s own schedule above its load-shedding tables, but reconciling this with the load-shedding timetables provided by ESP has proven a challenge for some and made it difficult for them to plan ahead. With the “Upcoming load-shedding” window, ESP will extract data from the timetables and show only the appropriate time and stages for a user’s chosen areas, as shown in the screenshot below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-453648" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ESP-new-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ESP-new-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ESP-new--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ESP-new--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Maritz said the “Upcoming load-shedding” update should roll out to users next week. He also told an ESP fan on Twitter that a future update would include the ability to configure the default 55-minute forewarning reminder. Maritz founded ESP alongside Dan Wells in 2015, and the app has since expanded its user base to more than 4 million. Maritz has been working full-time on expanding ESP’s functionality and sustainability since January 2022. Wells recently announced he would join Maritz full-time to continue growing the app together. In a recent write-up, Maritz highlighted several ways ESP had grown its revenue streams in the past six months, including: The pair have also been building out the capabilities of the AskMyStreet hyperlocal chat feature, which lets users talk to one another about what is happening in their area.
