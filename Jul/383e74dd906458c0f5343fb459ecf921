Acer laptops are built with key features that enable them to withstand the wear and tear of daily use. The popular brand then tests its professional laptops thoroughly and puts its money where its mouth is through the Acer 3-year onsite warranty that it offers with its Travelmate devices. Here’s how it works. Acer has always been committed to ensuring its devices are reliable – and this was evident in the 1-year onsite warranty it offers with Acer laptops. To strengthen its commitment to South African users and show its unwavering confidence in the reliability of its products, Acer has extended the coverage on its Travelmate range of laptops to a 3-year warranty. This 3-year warranty gives you even more protection in the rare case there is a flaw in your Acer Travelmate laptop. As it is an onsite warranty, Acer will also collect the device from your premises so that you are not inconvenienced. This extended warranty service shows Acer’s commitment to reliability in its professional Travelmate devices. Acer’s Travelmate laptops offer revolutionary performance and unmatched energy efficiency, making them the best business laptops on the market. They are easily portable thanks to their thin and light architecture, while their long battery life ensures you can use them on the go. Acer’s business focus is also made clear through the Travelmate’s security features, which include a fingerprint reader and a camera shutter to protect your privacy and data. The Travelmate range comprises several units with different use cases in mind – providing the perfect device frontline workers, administrators, managers, or executives.
