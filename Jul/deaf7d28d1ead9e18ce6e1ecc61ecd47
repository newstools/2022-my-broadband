Apple has reduced the maximum trade-in values of the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac in the US. It also appears that iStore in South Africa now also offers less for the company’s older smartphones than a few months ago. Macrumors recently discovered the new values on Apple’s US trade-in website. The publication provided a summary of the updated prices for iPhone models, which is shown below: The updated maximum trade-in values for Macs, iPads and Apple watches are as follows: Trade-in programmes such as Apple’s have grown in popularity as the prices of premium tech have increased, making it more affordable for consumers to upgrade to the latest model from their favourite brand. There has also been a sharper focus on reusing components in the wake of supply shortages and more attention on the responsible recycling of e-waste. One of the biggest facilitators of smartphone trade-ins in South Africa, Regener8, recently told MyBroadband that the country still had some catching up to do regarding trade-in and refurbishment services. The company’s clients include Cellucity, Digicape, Incredible Connection, MTN, Samsung, Vodacom, and the iStore. The latter has also significantly reduced its trade-in values for several iPhone models. MyBroadband compared trade-in programmes in late March 2022 to see which offered the best value. We included three iPhones in our analysis — the iPhone 11, iPhone 12, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. As of Wednesday, 6 July 2022, the maximum trade-in values for each of these models at the iStore had dropped by an average of 11%. The exact changes in trade-in values are shown below: It should be noted that the decrease in trade-in values could be due to the devices decreasing in value in the past three months and may not necessarily be related to Apple’s changes.
