DStv subscribers have been experiencing issues streaming live TV on its app with the media streaming devices, according to multiple posts on Twitter and reports on Downdetector. Customers attempting to stream live TV would be presented with only a black screen. According to DStv, the issue has now been resolved. A look at Downdetector revealed that reports of the issue began at around 18:00 on Thursday, 24 February 2022. Several users took to Twitter to voice their frustration with the outage. “Looks like @DStv @DStvCare are already trying out their software to cut streaming ability even though I am only 1, but something has gone wrong because I cannot stream anything at all on my android mibox TV since yesterday. Anyone else having the same problem?” one wrote. “@DStv is there an issue with your streaming service. I am using a Mibox4 and get a black screen when trying to load a live channel,” another post said. MyBroadband contacted MultiChoice on Friday afternoon, and a representative said they were aware of the black screen issue on the DStv streaming platform, and were working on implementing a fix. Shortly after that, MultiChoice reported that they had fixed the problem. They didn’t immediately say what had caused the issue. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-435286" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Downdetector-DStv-app-outage.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="316" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Downdetector-DStv-app-outage.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Downdetector-DStv-app-outage-600x237.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Downdetector-DStv-app-outage-768x303.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> MultiChoice recently announced that from 22 March 2022, DStv subscribers would be limited to streaming live TV on one device at a time. Subscribers will still be able to watch downloaded Catch Up content on a second device. “We will not limit the number of people using a login, however, we are limiting the number of people who can stream at the same time,” MultiChoice explained. “Password sharing and piracy are challenges for streaming providers globally,” it stated. “As part of our ongoing efforts to counteract password sharing and piracy, while continuing to bring you the best viewing experience, we will be introducing measures to limit concurrent streaming.” All DStv subscribers across Africa will be affected by the change. The announcement led to DStv facing a backlash from its South Africans, with some even calling for a boycott of the MultiChoice-owned broadcaster.
