The South African National Roads Agency’s (Sanral) toll tariff increases, which will take effect from 1 March 2022, have been published. Sanral’s tariffs are adjusted annually and are determined based on inflation according to the Consumer Price Index from Statistics South Africa. The increase gazetted as of 11 February 2022 is 5%. Discounts still apply at specific toll plazas for frequent users and qualifying local users. “The roads agency sympathises with the South African public considering the current state of the economy,” said Sanral communications manager Vusi Mona. “However, it’s equally important to introduce the adjustments to ensure that it continues to deliver quality roads and services to the benefit of the public.” According to Mona, funds received from toll fees are used to maintain, operate, improve toll roads, and service debt associated with the implementation of a toll road project. Economic infrastructure like the national road network is a prerequisite to providing essential services such as electricity, water, sanitation, telecoms, and public transport. The department of transport, through Sanral, uses selective tolling to implement significant road infrastructure projects. 13% of South Africa’s 22,253km road network is made up of toll roads. The toll tariff rates for South Africa’s major roads are provided below. The tariffs are split into two categories — conventional toll fees and Gauteng e-toll fees. The toll tariffs on each major highway in South Africa are summarised in the table below. They exclude Gauteng’s e-toll tariffs. Gauteng’s e-toll tariffs are summarised in the table below.
