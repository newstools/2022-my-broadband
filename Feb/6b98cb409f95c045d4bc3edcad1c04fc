Bitmart is a leading manufacturer and supplier of cryptocurrency mining hardware and blockchain products – and offers high-quality mining rigs and cryptocurrency merchandise that can help you begin your lucrative mining journey. To illustrate how you can make a sizeable profit by mining cryptocurrency, Bitmart provided the example below. Bitmart provided a practical example of cryptocurrency mining using Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. The example took place from 5 March 2018 to 9 December 2021 using a starting capital investment of R504,000. Bitmart compared the profits of buying cryptocurrency mining rigs with this money versus buying Ethereum of the same value (37.063 Ether), and holding it for the same period. In this experiment, buying and holding both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic yielded a net profit of just over R2 million across the 1375-day period if sold at the all-time High price of Ethereum. However, this figure was dwarfed by the R5-million income produced by investing in rigs and mining throughout the same period and the ETH was sold at an average low R41,976.04 per coin instead of the R70,000 all time high price like in the buy and Hold scenario. After all operating costs were accounted for, the net profit from mining was over 50% higher than the normal buy and sell method, totalling an astounding R3 million – a six-fold return on your initial investment. The total costs and all calculations for this investment are detailed in the table below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-432644" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bitmart-Calculation-481x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="572" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bitmart-Calculation-481x430.jpg 481w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bitmart-Calculation-448x400.jpg 448w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bitmart-Calculation-768x686.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bitmart-Calculation-1200x1072.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bitmart-Calculation.jpg 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Here you can see that the estimated total costs and losses due to possible equipment failure for this example are just under R2.3 million. This includes a worst-case scenario for power consumption, losses due to load-shedding, and hardware failures and replacements. Since this is a worst-case scenario, and because you could also take out insurance on your mining rig to mitigate risk, the net profit of R3 million could be even higher in a real-world scenario. To make it even easier to start your mining journey, Bitmart has partnered with Altcointrader to bring you an incredible R5,000 discount on mining rigs.
