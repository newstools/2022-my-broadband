Telkom has released a trading update for its third quarter ending on 31 December 2021, showing declines in group revenue, earnings, and capital expenditure. However, it also posted 10% growth in its active mobile customer base from December 2020. Prepaid subscribers grew from 12,354,754 to 13,839,870 (12%). Postpaid subscribers increased from 2,576,916 to 2,590,437 (1.8%). Blended average revenue per user (ARPU) decreased to R91.45. While postpaid ARPU increased from R211.75 to R215.49, Telkom saw a significant decline in prepaid ARPU from R79.51 to R66.68. Mobile data traffic increased by 7.9% year-on-year to 246 petabytes, supporting mobile data revenue growth of 2.6% year-on-year to R3.1 billion. Mobile broadband customers increased by 4% to 10.5 million and represented 63.6% of active customers. “The Consumer business revenue was relatively stable and comparable to the quarters reported in this financial year at R6.5 billion with a marginal decrease of 0.8% year-on-year,” Telkom stated. “We continue to aggressively drive technology refresh to newer technologies, such as fibre and LTE, as well as the utilisation of nascent 5G technology.” Telkom said capital expenditure of R2 billion improved capacity and coverage with 7,082 base stations now integrated, representing a 15.4% year-on-year increase in base stations. It added that the cost reductions promised by its additional roaming agreement with MTN are still to be realised. This is despite MTN announcing in its most recent quarterly trading update that it started providing Telkom with 2G, 3G, and 4G services from 1 November 2021. This roaming deal came as a surprise because Telkom undertook an extensive project in 2019 to switch roaming partners from MTN to Vodacom, which caused havoc for subscribers.
