Eskom says it has recovered sufficient generating capacity to avoid implementing more load-shedding on Tuesday evening. During a media briefing in the late afternoon, Eskom CEO André de Ruyter said the utility had about 4,000MW less in unplanned outages than on Monday. The utility was forced to implement stage 2 load-shedding for eight hours on Monday evening, after losing around 2,000MW of capacity due to trips and breakdowns during the day. Unavailable capacity at the time of briefing was as follows: De Ruyter added that diesel levels at Eskom’s open-cycle gas turbines also looked “fine” and that pumped storage dam levels were in “reasonable shape”. That means Eskom had appropriate emergency generation for peak demand. De Ruyter said unless there were any unforeseen trip of a plant or other system update, no load-shedding would be implemented on Tuesday evening from 21:00 to 05:00. Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer explained that there had been significant recoveries at Kusile Power Station. Two other big units — one at Kendal and another at Duvha — with over 600MW of capacity each were also set to return to the grid on Tuesday. He warned, however, that Eskom would have to be extremely careful with managing the system on Wednesday, as several units had to be taken down for maintenance, and none were expected to return to service. Eskom head of generation Philip Dukashe explained that a unit each at Matla and Arnot would go offline during the day. Matla Unit 1 needed eight hours of downtime for work on its generator, while Arnot Unit 1 required more extensive work on its air heater, which would take around three days to complete. Dukashe said Eskom was aiming to maintain its unplanned losses down to 10,000MW.
