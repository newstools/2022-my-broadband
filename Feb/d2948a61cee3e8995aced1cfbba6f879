MultiChoice has announced that from 22 March 2022, DStv subscribers will be limited to streaming on one device at a time. Subscribers will still be able to watch previously downloaded content on a second device. “We will not limit the number of people using a login, however, we are limiting the number of people who can stream at the same time,” MultiChoice explained. “Password sharing and piracy are challenges for streaming providers globally,” it stated. “As part of our ongoing efforts to counteract password sharing and piracy, while continuing to bring you the best viewing experience, we will be introducing measures to limit concurrent streaming.” All DStv packages across Africa will be affected by the change. Other features such as offline viewing and the number of devices you can have registered for streaming does not change. You are still allowed up to four registered devices. MultiChoice also emphasised that there is no change to pricing. The change will not impact Showmax customers either. It only applies when streaming DStv, MultiChoice said.
