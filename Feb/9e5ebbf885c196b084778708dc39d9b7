Telkom’s wholesale fixed-line division Openserve saw sustained growth in the past year, according to its latest trading update for the quarter ended 31 December 2021. The total number of homes passed with Openserve fibre reached 801,084, 65.5% more than at the same time in 2020. 44.8% of these homes have opted for packages on Openserve’s network, compared to 56.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. While this means the number of homes connected with Openserve fibre was lower in proportion to the operator’s total coverage footprint, Telkom said this was due to the lag between passing and connecting homes. Overall, Openserve’s active fibre connections increased by 38.6%. The increase in connections led to a 23% surge in fixed traffic, which reached 428 petabytes during the quarter. The demand for fibre services helped Openserve offset some revenue losses due to declining DSL and voice lines. The division reported revenue of R3.35 million, which was around 1.2% lower than in the last quarter of 2020. Telkom has upped its fixed-line investment in Openserve in recent years to reverse its sustained decline in fixed broadband subscribers and make an aggressive play for Vumatel’s home fibre crown. The company saw its first quarterly increase in fixed broadband customers since March 2016, going from 562,552 to 567,853 subscribers — a marginal 0.9% bump in numbers. However, broadband subscribers are still down year-on-year, and Openserve lags behind Vumatel in homes passed with fibre. As of November 2021, Vumatel had passed more than 1.2 million homes, 400,000 more than Openserve. Assuming Openserve follows up 2022 with similar fibre rollout growth of 65.5%, it will have passed 1.3 million homes by the end of the year. By that time, Vumatel is likely to have also passed more homes. As a reference, it was targeting 350,000 to 400,000 homes in the current financial year. If it replicates this in the next financial year, it should pass 1.6 million homes by the end of 2022. Openserve does have an advantage over Vumatel, thanks to its well-established fixed network infrastructure. The operator has around 165,900km of existing fibre infrastructure in the ground, compared to Vumatel’s 31,000km. Openserve can also replace its ailing copper network infrastructure with fibre, reusing existing conduits and other passive infrastructure. These factors mean Openserve’s fibre rollouts cost comparatively less than its rivals. That has seemingly also enabled it to price its packages more aggressively to capture a larger market share. The pricing of its entry-level products with a 25Mbps download speed often beat comparable lines from competitors, including Vumatel’s 20Mbps offering. The company recently launched its Openserve Web Connect product, rivalling other low-cost offerings like Vuma Reach and Frogfoot Air.
