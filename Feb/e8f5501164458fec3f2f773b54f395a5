The affordable new generation of Wisenet Q series offers simple and essential features that are ideal in securing small to medium-sized applications such as retail, banking, hospitality, and commercial environments, while delivering sharp and clear image quality. The Wisenet Q series offers a competitive range of indoor and outdoor bullet, dome, vandal resistant and PTZ cameras, available in 5, 4 and 2MP options. The cameras are equipped with a wide range of intelligent video analytics features, helping users to detect different types of incidents and maintain full situational awareness of their facility. Conventional horizontally oriented video streams waste bandwidth and storage along their edges in narrow areas such as store aisles or long hallways. Wisenet Q’s Hallway view creates a vertically oriented 3:4 or 9:16 ratio video stream to maximise usable image space in a narrow environment. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434644" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Q-series-in.png" alt="" width="640" height="189" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Q-series-in.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Q-series-in-600x177.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “It is possible to greatly reduce Bandwidth and Storage using Hanwha Techwin’s WiseStream II video H.265 compression technology.” “As a result, system costs such as network infrastructure and data storage, are also greatly reduced,” says Clifton Greeff. Wisenet Q also boasts an impressive image for difficult scenes with harsh backlighting as well as a good colour image in low light conditions and furthermore an evenly spread infra-red lit image in extreme lowlighting conditions, making this the perfect camera for your full 24 HR surveillance needs. Wisent Q series is also fully NDAA compliant with full cybersecurity penetration tests reports available online. “When used in conjunction with Milestone XProtect and Duxbury Switches, you can offer your client a system that is scalable, affordable, and open for integration to fire panels, electric fences and Intrusion panels.” “Hanwha Techwin’s Wisenet Q range and Milestone have deep integrations with all alerts and alarms originating from Wisent Q on board analytics” says Greeff.
