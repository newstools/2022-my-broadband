South Africa’s state-owned companies falling under the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies owe R771 million in unpaid invoices from their suppliers. Communications minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni revealed the figure in a written response to questions from Democratic Alliance MP Hendrik Krüger. Krüger had asked the minister what number of supplier invoices currently remain unpaid by her department and each entity reporting to her for more than 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and 120 days. In addition, the DA MP wanted to know the amounts outstanding in each instance and by what date the bills would be settled. The minister said her department did not have any outstanding bills, but nearly all the entities that report to her do. The biggest culprit was the South Africa Post Office (SAPO), which owes R485 million across 196 supplier bills. What makes matters even worse for the struggling postal service is that it is the only entity reporting to the department with no funds to settle any part of these outstanding bills. Ntshavheni said while the Post Office has developed a new strategy to improve its operational and financial performance, it would require funding from the government to be successful. The Post Office also recently put fourteen of its properties up for sale via auction. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-397581 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Post-Office-1.jpg" alt="Post Office" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Post-Office-1.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Post-Office-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Post-Office-1-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Post-Office-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Aside from SAPO, the entity with the largest outstanding amount was the State IT Agency (SITA), which owed R181.2 million from 210 bills. Telecoms infrastructure operator Broadband Infraco (BBI) had the third biggest bill, with R61.53 million outstanding. Of all the entities reporting to the minister, only the .ZA Domain Name Authority (ZADNA) did not have any outstanding bills. The table below shows how much each entity owes suppliers. Aside from SAPO, all the other entities provided rough timelines for settling their bills. These were as follows:
