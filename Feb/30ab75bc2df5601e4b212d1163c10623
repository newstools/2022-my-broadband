Samsung recently added the Galaxy S21 FE (Fan Edition) 5G to its epic Galaxy series, and it has many flagship features – including an awesome display and potent performance. The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G is inspired by the favourite features of #GalaxyFans, so we interviewed several long-time #GalaxyFans to find out what they love about Samsung’s smartphones. A common favourite feature that was highlighted by the #GalaxyFans we interviewed is the quality and durability of the Galaxy series, with one #GalaxyFan being a regular visitor to areas that put their smartphone to the test. “What I love about the Galaxy series is the durability – the dustproofing, waterproofing, and Gorilla Glass are vital for my day-to-day visits to construction sites,” they said. Samsung understands that #GalaxyFans love a durable smartphone, which is why it equipped the Galaxy S21 FE 5G with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus that is fitted to an IP68-rated, water-resistant chassis. Another #GalaxyFan stated that the large batteries of the Galaxy smartphones have been critical to their work. “The battery life is phenomenal. I work events all day and don’t have to stress about finding a plug to keep in touch with my team. It takes the stress out of a busy day,” explained the #GalaxyFan. Many #GalaxyFans can attest to this, which is why the Galaxy S21 FE 5G is powered by a tremendous 4,500mAh battery that lasts all day. Another key feature that #GalaxyFans loved was support for Samsung Pay. “I use it every day when I go to the shops and I don’t carry any physical cards with me anymore because everything is on my phone,” said one #GalaxyFan. Another added that “it is very quick and secure to make payments on the run.” It was therefore a top priority for the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G to support Samsung Pay – which it does. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433088" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The AMOLED display on the Galaxy series smartphones is another favourite of #GalaxyFans, and one explained how this superior screen allows him to easily use his smartphone in direct sunlight.
