Axxess is always striving to reduce the price of its Uncapped Internet products to make them even more affordable, and in line with this, it has slashed its Uncapped MTN LTE prices. These new deals offer clients Uncapped Internet starting from only R299pm and go up to R779pm for their new and improved Uncapped LTE Pro – along with a discounted price on a compatible CAT6 router. For only R299pm, you can get Uncapped Fixed LTE with a speed of up to 10Mbps, which is a perfect alternative to ADSL and for customers who can’t get Fibre in their area. As with all Axxess Uncapped LTE deals, there is no installation needed – you can simply plug your router in and enjoy unlimited data to surf the net to your heart’s content. Uncapped LTE Pro offers remarkably high connection speeds with an AUP of 1,000GB – all for only R779p/m. When the AUP is reached, the speeds – which until this point rely exclusively on the router and network coverage – will change to 1Mbps. Uncapped LTE Pro is a promotional package and is valid until further notice. Once the Promotion has ended, the monthly fee of R949.00 will apply. To get the best performance from your LTE, you can choose to buy an approved router on checkout if you do not have one of MTN’s approved routers. CAT6 routers support the LTE Advanced standard to produces a faster and better broadband experience. Additionally, Axxess’s Uncapped LTE deals can be used anywhere within the coverage areas of MTN LTE, and average speeds are dependent on AUP within the specified coverage areas. Since the MTN network has a wide coverage range throughout South Africa, you should experience lightning-quick speeds almost anywhere you go.
