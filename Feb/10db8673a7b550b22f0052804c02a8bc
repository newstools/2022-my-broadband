A cloud PBX, also known as hosted PBX, offer many benefits over an on-premise system, like lower costs, more flexibility, and powerful analytics. Unlike an on-premise PBX system, a cloud PBX runs over an internet connection and is hosted in a secure off-site data centre. A cloud PBX offers the same functionality as a traditional PBX, like calling, voicemail, and call forwarding. These are, however, only the tip of the iceberg. Unlike a traditional PBX, a cloud-based hosted PBX does not require expensive on-site equipment that is costly and requires constant maintenance. It offers great flexibility, making it possible to add or remove users on the fly and support multiple locations – a big benefit of remote working. Cloud PBX systems have excellent uptime to ensure business continuity. Another benefit is that all updates and maintenance are performed by your hosted PBX provider. It is very cost-effective. Apart from saving on hardware costs, VoIP calls are much cheaper than traditional fixed-line calls, and users typically enjoy free on-net calling. Cloud-based hosted PBX systems also offer powerful features, like mobile device support, voice call transcription, built-in video conferencing, call analytics, and strong security. With these benefits in mind, it is not surprising that many South African companies are ditching their traditional PBX system in preference of a hosted PBX. This trend accelerated during the lockdown with remote working requiring flexible solutions with good analytics to monitor the performance of employees. This raises the question of which South African companies have the best cloud PBX offerings.
