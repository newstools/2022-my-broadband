Cell C has revamped its Home Connecta Flexi prepaid offering and launched several new bundles, starting with a 2GB + 2GB option for R45, valid for 14 days. The Home Connecta Flexi product was first introduced in March 2021 as an LTE prepaid broadband solution for customers requiring affordable, on-the-go Internet access with no monthly commitment. The company said it now has more than a million customers. Cell C chief commercial officer, Simo Mkhize, explained that the company used customers’ usage and feedback to adapt the product. “We realised that some of our customers needed a more affordable entry point into Home Connecta Flexi, while others needed slightly more data each month.” “We have created bundles to cater for these needs while still remaining the most competitively priced in the broadband category,” Mkhize said. Comparing the previous offers with the new products shows that Cell C has opted to remove the 5GB + 5GB package at R59, replacing it with a 6GB + 6GB bundle at R89. The previous 50GB + 50GB package for R199 has also been replaced with a 40GB + 40GB bundle at R189. The 25GB + 25GB bundle has remained, but with a price reduction from R179 to R169. Bundles that keep the same allocation and prices are the 10GB + 10GB, 100GB + 100GB, 200GB + 200GB, and 1TB options. It should be noted that while most of the bundles are valid for 30 days, the cheapest 2GB + 2GB offer is only valid for 14 days.
