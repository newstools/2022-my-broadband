MSI and Ubisoft have partnered to bring you the MSI Crosshair 15 Rainbow Six Extraction Edition gaming laptop, which is coming to South Africa soon. It is equipped with the latest 12th-gen processors from Intel and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs to provide gamers with unrivalled performance. “When players squad-up to enter the Containment Zone in Extraction, this is the type of mobile gaming rig they will want to do it on,” said Marc Desfosses, Ubisoft Lead Programmer of Rainbow Six Extraction. “We are excited about how the laptop looks, how it performs, and how gamers are going to enjoy playing all of their games on it, especially Extraction,” Desfosses said. This is because the MSI Crosshair 15 features exclusive REACT design elements from Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction that bring the game to life. These include highlighted and brighter WASD keys for faster and more reactive movements, as well as a backlit keyboard with futuristic colours from within the game. Additionally, you can get a special edition bundle that includes a Rainbow Six Extraction mouse pad and gaming mouse to complete your setup, as well as a game code for the new Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction Deluxe Edition. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-435258 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MSI-Crosshair-15-Rainbow-Six-Extraction-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MSI-Crosshair-15-Rainbow-Six-Extraction-2.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MSI-Crosshair-15-Rainbow-Six-Extraction-2-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MSI-Crosshair-15-Rainbow-Six-Extraction-2-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The MSI Crosshair 15 Rainbow Six Extraction Edition features the latest 12th-gen Intel Core i7 processors to take care of your most demanding games.
