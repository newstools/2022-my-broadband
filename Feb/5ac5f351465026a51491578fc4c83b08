The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) has apprehended a notorious tech thief suspected to be behind a raft of burglaries at the City of Joburg’s Metropolitan Centre in Braamfontein. The 38-year-old female suspect was caught with a bag of loot inside the building that houses the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) offices during the early morning hours on Monday. Joburg City’s group forensics and investigation service spokesperson Lucky Sindane said a patrolling security guard spotted the suspect while she was trying to break an emergency exit door. After requesting backup, JMPD officers arrived on the scene and searched the building from the second floor. They found the suspected thief hiding behind the door of an office that she had allegedly also broken into. “She could not explain what she was doing in the building after the officers questioned her,” Sindane said. In her possession, the officers discovered computer hardware, including hard drives, RAM sticks, processors, and one of the IEC’s voter management devices, as well as a variety of breaking implements. The image below shows the desktop computers she had allegedly stripped for parts. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-432980" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripped-computers-e1644232511888.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="460" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripped-computers-e1644232511888.jpg 1643w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripped-computers-e1644232511888-600x345.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripped-computers-e1644232511888-640x368.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripped-computers-e1644232511888-768x442.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripped-computers-e1644232511888-1536x883.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Stripped-computers-e1644232511888-1200x690.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Sindane said the suspect is supposedly a service provider for the city and is registered as a director of five companies. She was previously arrested for a similar crime in October 2020, in which she supposedly targeted the third, fourth, and fifth floors of Block A at the Metro Centre. However, the case against her in that instance was thrown out of court due to a lack of evidence. In another incident, she was arrested after being caught loitering in the building. She was also spotted in the Metro Centre on CCTV camera footage from 24 January 2022, carrying two bags containing hard drives stolen from computers in the Development Planning and Group Legal and Contract Services offices. Her latest arrest comes after the city’s mayor, Mpho Phalatse, promised that stringent security measures would be implemented at the building to prevent future incidents. At the time, she said police knew the suspect’s identity and address and that she would be surprised if the suspect had not been arrested. She called on Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela to act, but it is unclear whether any efforts were made to apprehend her. Sindane said the suspect is now expected to appear in the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court, where she will be charged with possession of suspected stolen goods, trespassing, and break-in.
