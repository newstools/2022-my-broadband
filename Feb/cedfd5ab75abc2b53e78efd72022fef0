The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is launching online payments for vehicle licence-related services on the eNatis portal. The addition of online payments will allow users to renew their vehicle or driver’s licences without visiting a driver’s licence testing centre (DLTC). “This new development is designed to enhance online renewals and bookings to create a seamless booking experience when using online booking services,” the RTMC said. “The introduction of online payments means that one can avoid long queues and simply renew online, make a payment and opt for home delivery.” The payment capability for motor vehicle licence renewals was initially believed to have gone live in October 2021, following a launch announcement by FNB, the platform’s payment facilitator. But the South African Post Office, which will handle deliveries of all documents renewed via the service, later confirmed the system had been delayed to early 2022 due to technical and legal requirements. Meanwhile, the Post Office launched its own online vehicle licence renewal service last week. Minister Fikile Mbalula also promised the eNatis online payment system was “coming soon” about a month ago. The pricing of the online payments was detailed in a recent gazette. While the online payments system is live, the RTMC said the services it enables would be launched “soon”. These services are summarised below. Individuals and corporates will be able to register an account online and pay the required amount for a vehicle disk renewal. Once the payment is concluded, the vehicle licence disc will either be posted or couriered to the vehicle owner at an additional fee. Motorists will pay between R28 and R99 for delivery, depending on how fast they want the disc delivered. There is also a R72 transaction fee. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-412710" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Licence-fees-featured-image-800-x-533.png" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Licence-fees-featured-image-800-x-533.png 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Licence-fees-featured-image-800-x-533-600x400.png 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Licence-fees-featured-image-800-x-533-640x426.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Licence-fees-featured-image-800-x-533-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Motorists will be able to renew and pay the prescribed card renewal fee online before they present themselves at a DLTC for fingerprints, photos and eye tests. The transaction fee for this service will also be R72, while the booking itself will cost R22. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431586" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Drivers-licence-cards-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Drivers-licence-cards-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Drivers-licence-cards--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Drivers-licence-cards--640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Drivers-licence-cards--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Participating financial institutions will be able to register vehicles online as title-holders, eliminating the need to go to a registering authority. The online vehicle registration fee will be levied on all registrations performed by financial institutions, car dealerships, insurance companies and large fleet operators. They will also be able to effect a change of ownership of a motor vehicle by the current title-holder. This online registration and release of title-holder function will allow identified institutions to record the event in real-time and ensure that the integrity of the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS) is enhanced and maintained, the RTMC said. According to the gazette, both the registering and changing ownership services will cost R530. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-432616" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1574636203-1-e1643875806282.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1574636203-1-e1643875806282.jpg 799w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1574636203-1-e1643875806282-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1574636203-1-e1643875806282-640x427.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1574636203-1-e1643875806282-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In September 2019, the RTMC developed the online crash reporting application, which allows members of the public to report minor crashes online without having to visit a South African Police Services (SAPS) station. This platform also allows individuals and insurance companies to retrieve their own or their policyholder’s crash information. Online payment for an electronic copy of the report will cost R60. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433192" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cra-crash-accident.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cra-crash-accident.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cra-crash-accident-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cra-crash-accident-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cra-crash-accident-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
