Spotify Technology SA’s Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek apologised to staff for the impact the controversy over Joe Rogan’s podcast has had on them, but said he didn’t agree with calls to drop the broadcaster from the service. “There are no words I can say to adequately convey how deeply sorry I am for the way ‘The Joe Rogan Experience’ controversy continues to impact each of you,” Ek said in a letter to staff, which was seen by Bloomberg News and verified by a spokesperson for Spotify. “Not only are some of Joe Rogan’s comments incredibly hurtful — I want to make clear that they do not represent the values of this company,” Ek said. “I know this situation leaves many of you feeling drained, frustrated and unheard.” Full text of Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s note to staff: pic.twitter.com/3FHlmzV3UW — Peter Kafka (@pkafka) February 7, 2022 A video compilation of Rogan using the N-word circulated Friday. In an Instagram post, Rogan described the video as “horrible” and said it was the “most regretful and shameful thing” he’s ever had to talk about. Rogan apologised Saturday for using the racial slur in past episodes of his popular podcast. Several episodes have since been removed from Spotify. He last week pledged more balance and better research for his podcast in a separate apology aimed at quelling growing controversy about misleading coronavirus information, which prompted musicians like Neil Young and Joni Mitchell to remove their music from the platform.
