FNB Premier customers do not have to burn a hole in their pocket, take out numerous home loans, or invest hundreds of thousands of rand to maximise their earning potential on the bank’s eBucks rewards programme. Banking customers often complain that these types of requirements to make a rewards programme worthwhile exceed its potential benefits. However, for FNB customers, a few adjustments to monthly spending and banking habits can quickly take you from rewards level 1 to level 5. Your rewards level determines what portion of expenses an FNB Premier customer earns back in eBucks when spending at the bank’s partners.

The table below shows the criteria that can get you to Level 5.
