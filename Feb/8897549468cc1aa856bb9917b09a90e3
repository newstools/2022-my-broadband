MTN has today unveiled its evolved visual identity, which it said is an “extension and visual representation of the Group’s refreshed strategy.” The company’s rebranded logo had already been spotted outside the company’s Johannesburg offices, and does away with the familiar white, yellow, and red text on a blue oval. Instead, “MTN” is written in simple block letters with an oval drawn around the characters – all in black, and on a yellow background. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434518" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-MTN-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="535" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-MTN-Logo.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-MTN-Logo-598x400.jpg 598w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-MTN-Logo-797x533.jpg 797w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-MTN-Logo-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-MTN-Logo-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The updated rebrand also includes the tagline “What are we doing today?”, which the company chose “not just because it’s loaded with so much meaning, but also because it’s so simple.” “It’s an incredibly human way to talk about progress, without having to say, ‘progress,’” the company added on its official brand refresh website. “It inspires with the reality that every day can be a fresh new start, full of potential.” The company said it will be “asking this question a lot” over the coming months, hinting towards a larger marketing campaign based on MTN’s new tagline. MTN added that its rebrand highlights its commitment to evolve and explore innovative initiatives that provide value to all its stakeholders. “Africa is never still. True progress can only be realised by ‘doing’,” said Bernice Samuels, MTN Group Executive for Marketing. “It is off this insight that we launch our new positioning by challenging, celebrating and providing tools for doers because when individuals, communities and countries progress, so too does Africa.” MTN Group President and CEO Ralph Mupita added that the rebrand places a greater focus on the youth of Africa. “It is a well-known fact that the youth are central to achieving this [Africa’s] potential,” said Mupita. “Whilst we remain focussed on all our customers and stakeholders, our brand evolution demonstrates an enhanced focus on the youth.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434690" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-logo-on-phone.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="535" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-logo-on-phone.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-logo-on-phone-598x400.jpg 598w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-logo-on-phone-797x533.jpg 797w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-logo-on-phone-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MTN-logo-on-phone-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
