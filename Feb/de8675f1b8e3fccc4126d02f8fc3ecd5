Smartphone manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung launched a slew of new devices in 2021, and South Africa’s major mobile network providers are offering them on contract. These high-end devices have hefty price tags if you buy them cash, resulting in many South Africans preferring to get them on contract. MyBroadband looked into the most powerful smartphones you can get on contract for less than R800 a month. All devices featured in the comparison offer 5G connectivity, at least 4GB RAM, and 64GB of internal storage. We compared deals on high-end devices from Cell C, MTN, Telkom, and Vodacom, focusing on data-centric packages. The smallest data allocation on the contract compared comes with the Vodacom RED Core 500MB package, which gives clients 500MB of Anytime and Night Owl data, 50 any-network minutes, and 150 SMSs. All of the Vodacom device contracts in this comparison come with this package. The largest data package — Telkom’s FreeMe 3GB bundle — offers subscribers 2GB of all-network data, 500MB of WhatsApp data, 500MB of streaming data, 150 any-network minutes, and 200 SMSs. It should be noted that Telkom currently has a promotion running on its FreeMe products, with subscribers receiving extra minutes and SMS allocations. The table below summarises the high-end smartphone you can get in South Africa on 24-month contracts for less than R800 per month. <img class="size-full wp-image-433450 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-black-V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-black-V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-black-V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-black-V-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-black-V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-427912 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Iphone-13800x533V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Iphone-13800x533V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Iphone-13800x533V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Iphone-13800x533V-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Iphone-13800x533V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-425336 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-Ultra-800-x-533V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-Ultra-800-x-533V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-Ultra-800-x-533V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-Ultra-800-x-533V-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-Ultra-800-x-533V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-433456 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-GreenV-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-GreenV-1.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-GreenV-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-GreenV-1-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-GreenV-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-391167 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OPPO-Reno5-5G-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OPPO-Reno5-5G-1.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OPPO-Reno5-5G-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OPPO-Reno5-5G-1-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OPPO-Reno5-5G-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-433454 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-coloursV.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-coloursV.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-coloursV-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-coloursV-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/iPhone-12-coloursV-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
