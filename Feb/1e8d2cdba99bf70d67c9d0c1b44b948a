Eskom has announced that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding from 21:00 tonight until 05:00 tomorrow morning. “Eskom regrets to inform the public that stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented from 21:00 tonight until 05:00 on Tuesday to conserve and replenish emergency reserves,” the state-owned power utility said. This comes after Eskom ended load-shedding eight hours early on Sunday, saying that it achieved sufficient recovery in generation capacity. “Since midnight we have lost a unit each at Camden, Kusile, Duvha and Matla power stations. Furthermore, the return of a unit at Kusile and two units at Majuba power stations are delayed,” Eskom stated. Total breakdowns amount to 16,261 MW while planned maintenance is 5,350MW of capacity. “Eskom appeals to all South Africans to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off non-essential items,” it said. The state-owned power utility implemented stage 2 load-shedding at 11:00 on Wednesday, 2 February and had planned to continue rotational power cuts until 05:00 this morning. It shifted to stage 1 load-shedding at 21:00 on Friday due to improved generation capacity and the traditionally reduced weekend demand. In daily media briefings during last week, Eskom explained that load-shedding was necessary to restore emergency reserves at its water-driven pumped storage facilities and diesel-powered open-cycle gas turbines. Eskom said that these emergency reserves are essential to meet peak demand during the week, and it usually aims to have them close to maximum every Monday.
