The Hisense 75U9G is one of the few Mini-LED TVs in South Africa, and we got to experience this cutting-edge technology first-hand. This was the first Mini-LED TV we have handled, and we were impressed by its incredible colour accuracy, contrast, and brightness. After unboxing our Hisense 75U9G, the software setup was a breeze and we were flipping through 4K content on YouTube within a few minutes. A standout feature of this TV is that it uses Mini-LED technology – the latest evolution in backlighting technology which offers significant advantages over traditional LED displays. Most LED TVs use a backlight with up to several hundred Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) that are of a similar size to a shirt button. These illuminate the LCD panel to create the image that you see. Mini-LED technology uses an array of much smaller LEDs – about as small as a grain of rice – to create the backlight. These Mini-LEDs form a more consistent backlight with better lighting control and superior local dimming that results in finer control over highlights and shadows, deeper blacks, better contrasts, and superior image quality – all of which we immediately noticed. More LEDs also means that the backlight can be closer to the pixel display, providing you with over 1,000 nits of brightness, a thinner TV, and a wider 178 degree viewing angle. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-432214" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Hisense-TV-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Hisense-TV-640x430.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Hisense-TV-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Hisense-TV-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Hisense-TV-768x516.jpg 768w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Hisense-TV-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Hisense-TV-1200x806.jpg 1200w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.-Hisense-TV.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> To complement the Mini-LED backlight, Hisense equipped the 75U9G with its Quantum Dot Colour technology that generates over one billion colours. It also features Hisense’s Hi-View Engine Pro technology that improves your viewing experience with AI, as well as additional features such as IMAX Enhanced with remastered 4K HDR10+ content, and TUV Rheinland-certified privacy functionality. In terms of performance, a 120Hz refresh rate and Hisense Ultra Motion provide you with smooth visuals whether you are gaming or watching a fast-paced action movie. Low Latency Mode (ALLM), and a Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) of 48-60Hz under 4K resolution then help to reduce input lag. 5GHz Wi-Fi 5 offers smooth online gaming and streaming, too, while the VIDAA U5 OS offers instant access to your favourite services – such as Netflix, YouTube, and DSTV – through dedicated remote buttons. These services can be enjoyed through the 75U9G’s dual 15-Watt speakers, and Hisense has even equipped the TV with Dolby Atmos to provide you with a 360-degree field of sound. We were impressed with the Hisense 75U9G and recommend it to anyone who wants to experience Mini-LED technology.
