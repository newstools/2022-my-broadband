Over the past ten years, the price of DStv increased by 40%, you pay double for a Big Mac, and uncapped ADSL is now 80% cheaper. This was revealed in an analysis by MyBroadband about the price changes of popular products in South Africa over the last decade. The price of a Big Mac, which is often used as a light-hearted economic guide, increased from R19.95 in 2012 to R39.90 in 2022. Over the same period, the price of a DStv Premium subscription increased by 40.5% – from R590 per month to R829 per month. Petrol and diesel prices have increased by 85% and 68%, respectively, reaching record highs over the last year. One service which bucked the trend is broadband access. A 10Mbps uncapped ADSL package from Axxess cost R1,599 in 2012 when it launched. The same service now costs R314, equating to 20% of the original price. Mobile broadband prices have declined even more than ADSL. In 2012, R149 per month would buy you a 2GB data contract from MTN on a special deal. Fast forward ten years, and you can now get 10GB anytime data, 20GB Youtube streaming data, 10GB MTN Home data, and 10GB Night Express data for the same price. Vodacom also featured promotions with 1GB for R99 per month and 2GB for R149 per month in 2012. Today, R149 per month can get you a 30GB data contract, which works out to a 93% reduction in price per GB. The table below provides an overview of price changes of popular products in South Africa over the past ten years.
