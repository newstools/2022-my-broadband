Typical South African households can expect to pay more than R200,000 for a solar power generation and storage system that can make them fully independent of Eskom’s electricity grid. After a festive season without power interruptions, the re-emergence of Eskom’s rotational power cuts in the first week of February has reminded South Africans that load-shedding will be around for some time. Eskom is taking two of its largest power generating units at the Koeberg nuclear power station offline in 2022, which means it will rely more on its unreliable coal-powered generation fleet. Emergency power generation that was initially set to come online at the end of the year will likely be delayed. Private renewable solar and wind projects will also take some time to add sufficient capacity to the grid to help relieve load-shedding. Many households and businesses have become fed up with having their power cut, opting to kick Eskom to the curb and handle their own electricity needs. But doing so is still very expensive, and breaking even on your purchase can take several years. We used online calculators from two reputable solar and energy storage companies — Solar Advice and Alumo — to see how much it would cost to go entirely off-grid. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431366" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Solar-panel-thief.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Solar-panel-thief.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Solar-panel-thief-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Solar-panel-thief-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Solar-panel-thief-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> There are three main components to an off-grid installation — generation, storage, and output. In terms of generating capacity, you will have to install a solar array that has sufficient exposure to the sun to supply electricity to your house during the day and fill up your batteries for night-time usage. According to Eskom’s latest available information, the average South African household uses about 900kWh of electricity every month, or 30kWh per day. Solar Advice and Alumo estimate that a 14-panel setup could provide over 30kWh of electricity per day. That assumes solar efficiency of less than 50%. The average household uses 65% of its electricity during the evening. That means you require battery storage of about 19.5kWh to power your home at night, given that your solar panels won’t be able to generate or directly feed electricity when the sun is not shining. The last component in your setup, your inverter, converts the energy from your solar panels and battery into useable electricity. When selecting a suitable inverter, you will have to consider the peak power (in Watts) your appliances can pull. Certain appliances have a very high peak wattage, and while they may only draw this for a very short period, your inverter will have to be able to provide that output, or you won’t be able to power them up. While most households rarely go above 5kW of peak usage, it is safer to consider something in the range of 8 to 10kW. Using the figures above as a minimum, we calculated how much an off-grid kit from Solar Advice and Alumo would cost. The table below shows a cost breakdown of Solar Advice’s system. Using Alumo’s instant invoice functionality, we could get an estimate for a system close to the specifications of the one from Solar Advice. In this instance, Alumo quoted R256,260 for the system, with all costs included. It should be noted that Alumo’s solution included a more expensive hybrid inverter than Solar Advice’s off-grid inverter. That means it can be used in grid-tied setups as well. Alumo also added a design and engineering fee, and commission costs. The table below shows a breakdown of the Alumo off-grid kit. One way to reduce the cost of an off-grid system is to conduct a complete energy efficiency audit. If you have not yet done so, replacing the most power-hungry appliances in your home, such as the stove, oven, and heaters, with gas versions will significantly reduce your power usage. In addition, a solar geyser can significantly reduce your overall electricity usage and peak power needs. You can downsize your system’s storage needs with enough demand reduction and save.
