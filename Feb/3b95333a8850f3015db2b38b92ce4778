Axxess was founded by Franco Barbalich in his one-bedroom flat in 1997. At the time, the company was called Axxess Africa and only offered website hosting and website design. As the company grew, it expanded into providing Internet access and analog dial-up services through Internet cafes. Along the way, it rebranded and became Axxess. Some of Axxess’s earliest clients have been with the company since its start-up days, and have transitioned from dial-up to ultra-fast fibre and LTE Internet. Today, Axxess is one of the largest privately owned ISPs in the country, and offers a multifaceted range of Internet services. “As we celebrate this milestone, we also celebrate our clients. Their loyalty has been nothing short of amazing since the beginning. Thank you, South Africa, for choosing Axxess as your preferred ISP,” said Axxess. Watch out for the next incredible deal and get ready for more special offers for a special year!
