Google has made its Chrome OS Flex available for early access, allowing Mac and PC users with ageing machines to turn their computer into a Chromebook. The operating system, which is based on CloudReady, should help extend the lives of Mac and Windows PCs that no longer receive official updates. Google terms Chrome OS Flex as a “free-to-download operating system”, and it offers identical features to what is found on today’s Chromebooks. The features include the same user interface, Chrome browser, cross-device integration with Android, cloud sync, and Google Assistant. Google said that you could use a bootable USB containing the operating system to install it. Those interested in trying out Chrome OS Flex can boot it from the USB to test it before installing it on their machine. Administrators can also install Chrome OS Flex via network deployment. According to 9to5Google, there are currently no plans to add the Google Play Store or support for Android applications to Chrome OS Flex. <img class="size-full wp-image-434176 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chrome-OS-Flex-how-it-works-800V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chrome-OS-Flex-how-it-works-800V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chrome-OS-Flex-how-it-works-800V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chrome-OS-Flex-how-it-works-800V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Regarding security, Chrome OS Flex features tab or application-level sandboxing, while “the read-only OS blocks executables where threats often hide.” It also offers Safe Browsing and the ability to remote wipe machines via Google’s admin console.
