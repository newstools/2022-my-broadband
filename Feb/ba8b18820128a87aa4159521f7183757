One of the most important criteria for youth-focused smartphones is the price. You’re simply not in a position to spend tens of thousands of rands on a device – there are university bills to pay, and the odd party to be had. But that doesn’t mean that you don’t want a smartphone that isn’t powerful, reliable and beautiful to look at and hold. Enter the HUAWEI nova Y9a, now available on shelves in South Africa. The latest addition to Huawei’s impressive nova range of smartphones, the HUAWEI nova Y9a offers a sleek design and impressive performance capabilities at a price that won’t break the bank. Here are some of the incredible specs you can ex-spec-t. Comprising a 64MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide angle camera, a 2MP depth camera and a 2MP macro camera, the HUAWEI nova Y9a guarantees professional-looking photographs every time. The main camera is fitted with an f/1.8 aperture capable of capturing images of up to 9248 x 6936 pixels. It also offers 34% higher resolution and excellent colour reproduction capability. The ultra-wide angle camera gives a 120° field of view and supports wide angle video recording, too. The depth camera and macro camera work together with the main camera to blur the background and highlight the subject and to capture microscopic detail. The HUAWEI nova Y9a also automatically detects subjects through five shooting modes, including children, pets, sports, flowers and landscapes, as well as over 10 shooting scenarios such as playing, jumping and cycling. The HUAWEI nova Y9a intelligently predicts the subject and nature of the shot and adjusts the shutter speed accordingly, ensuring that every moment is beautifully frozen in time. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433270" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huawei-Camera.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huawei-Camera.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huawei-Camera-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Huawei-Camera-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The HUAWEI nova Y9a boasts a 6.63-inch 3D arc design, resulting in a 20:9 form factor that closely resembles the feeling of a 5.5-inch smartphone. It also comes standard with HUAWEI FullView display to deliver an immersive viewing experience that has to be seen to be believed. In the new nova Y9a, Huawei has removed the notch area by inserting a pop-up selfie camera in a design that is regarded as the best version of the front camera to date. The HUAWEI nova Y9a also adopts the other novas’ classic halo ring design. The device’s sleek square camera arrangement is surrounded by an outer ring engraved by a unique coating process. The design is reminiscent of the rings of Saturn and is both elegant and unmistakeably nova. Inspired by the natural colours of the sky, the HUAWEI nova Y9a comes in Midnight Black and Space Silver. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433264" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hauwei-Phones_.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hauwei-Phones_.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hauwei-Phones_-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hauwei-Phones_-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> With a 4200mAh battery and 40W HUAWEI SuperCharge, your battery worries are a thing of the past.
