Towards the middle of 2020, when the pandemic closed borders and drove most countries into lockdown, nuvoteQ was approached by a life science pharmaceutical company in India with a very specific need – they were looking for a life science clinical trials platform. The strict timelines of this specific study required us to be quite imaginative in the way we approached the project. The solution involved the deployment of our proprietary web-based software solution (Nukleus), an Electronic Direct Capturing (EDC) platform designed for the collection of clinical data in electronic format for use mainly in human clinical trials. Using Nukleus, which we host with AWS solutions, we were able to streamline data collection, which helped expedite the vaccine’s time to market. We were able to repurpose a lot of previous studies and all of the data created the foundation of this particular study. As a result, we were able to create specific categories in two weeks – a process that would typically take 8-12 weeks. It’s been a great honour to help deliver a solution aimed at curbing the pandemic in the world’s most  populous country. nuvoteQ is a Proudly EOH company <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
