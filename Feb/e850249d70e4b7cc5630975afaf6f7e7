However, when something goes wrong, we want you to know immediately.” Standard Bank told MyBroadband that users can still transact through its cellphone banking platform. “Customers who are not able to transact can use our cellphone banking by dialling *120*2345# and following the prompts. Apologies for the inconvenience,” it said. Update — 15:07 Standard Bank informed MyBroadband the problems related to logging into its mobile banking app and Internet banking had been resolved. “All our Internet and Mobile Banking services have now been fully restored,” the bank said. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused.”
