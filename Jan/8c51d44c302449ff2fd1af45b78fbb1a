Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk lambasted Twitter’s development of profile pictures linked to non-fungible tokens on Friday morning, saying the social media company has the wrong priorities. Posting a screenshot of Twitter’s new feature, Musk said “this is annoying” and followed up with criticism of crypto-related spam. Musk was considered a champion of digital assets until May 2021, when he questioned the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. He has since taken a more eclectic approach to crypto, although he continues to integrate digital currencies into his business, including accepting payments for merchandise in meme currency Dogecoin. Twitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg. Twitter is spending engineering resources on this bs while crypto scammers are throwing a spambot block party in every thread!? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 21, 2022
