Intel’s Alder Lake mobile processors are running circles around Apple’s powerful M1 Max chip, benchmarks from multiple reputed tech publications have revealed. Tom’s Hardware and Macworld recently pitted the top-of-the-line Core i9-12900HK in an MSI GE76 Raider gaming laptop against the M1 Max in 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. Using multiple benchmark tools, the Core i9 consistently outperformed the M1 Max. In Tom’s Hardware’s tests, for example, it achieved a marginal 3% victory for single-core performance with a score of 1,833 compared to the M1 Max’s 1,781. In multi-core testing, its lead was a more significant 6%, with a score of 13,456 compared to 12,683. That is likely due to having four more cores than the M1 Max. The graph below illustrates these findings. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431908" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max--640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Macworld recorded similar results in its Geekbench 5 test. In single-core performance, the Core i9 hit 1,838 compared to the M1 Max’s 1,774, while the multi-core test saw it lead 13,235 to 12,590. Tom’s Hardware also performed video transcoding tests in Handbrake, which again saw the Core i9 come out on top, with a rendering time of 4:44 compared to 4:48 for the M1 Max. In its Cinebench R23 tests, Intel’s chip consistently outscored the M1 Max over 20 runs, as shown in the graph below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431910" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max-Cinebench.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max-Cinebench.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max-Cinebench-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max-Cinebench-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Toms-Hardware-i9-vs-M1-Max-Cinebench-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While the Core i9-12900HK outpaced the M1 Max in raw performance, there is one crucial area where it lags — power efficiency. The Core i9 has a thermal design power (TDP) that can range between 45W and 115W, depending on the intensity of its workload. Tom’s Hardware recorded a maximum power draw of 94W on the chip in the multi-core tests, whereas its sister publication Anandtech found the M1 Max only drew up to 34W. The overall impact of these differences — the MacBook Pro lasted 15 and a half hours in Tom’s Hardware’s battery tests, whereas the GE76 Raider held out for just over 4 hours. That means Apple had roughly three to four times better power efficiency, a factor that will certainly count for those looking for machines that can last without being plugged in.
