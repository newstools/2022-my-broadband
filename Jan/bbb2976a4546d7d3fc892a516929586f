Pick n Pay has rolled out a vehicle licence disc renewal and traffic fine management pilot programme in 1,429 stores across South Africa. While a similar service has been available at selected Spar and Pick n Pay stores in partnership with Renewonline, the new system works through an online portal and is more widely available. Customers can register online or at a Pick n Pay till point. They must then upload the requested documentation to the online portal and provide a delivery address. After requesting a renewal, customers may choose to pay in a Pick n Pay store. They can then may the payment at Pick n Pay Supermarkets, Hypermarkets, Clothing, Liquor, Market, and Express stores. A courier should deliver the new licence disc within 10 business days, Pick n Pay said. Pick n Pay said that if there are any outstanding fines blocking your renewal, you will have the option to include these fines in your payment. If you do not settle the fines, your disc can’t be renewed, it said. Once you’ve set up the renewal, the payment amount will be linked to your cellphone number, which you can provide as a reference when making payment in-store. Pick n Pay charges a licence disc renewal admin fee of R345 and a delivery fee of R99. PnP VLR disc renewal
