Just when you thought HUAWEI couldn’t top its impressive range of nova smartphones, the international technology giant has gone and done it again. The HUAWEI nova Y9a has just launched in South Africa and is everything you’ve come to expect and more from this series of youth-focused devices. Last year saw the release of several impressive nova smartphones, including the nova Y60, nova 8, nova 8i and nova 9. While 2022’s brand-new HUAWEI nova Y9a fits in seamlessly with this impressive range, it also sets itself apart in a number of remarkable ways. With its flagship inspired design, the HUAWEI nova Y9a comes loaded with a 64MP quad-camera setup, a 6.63-inch FullView Display, 40W HUAWEI SuperCharge and 8GB + 128GB of storage. The device’s camera includes a 64MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide angle camera, a 2MP depth camera and a 2MP macro camera. These four cameras work together to create professional-looking photographs with a 34% higher resolution and excellent colour reproduction capabilities. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431952" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Huawei-Nova-9-Launch-1_.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Huawei-Nova-9-Launch-1_.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Huawei-Nova-9-Launch-1_-595x400.png 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Huawei-Nova-9-Launch-1_-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Photos taken on your HUAWEI nova Y9a can comfortably be printed as large as 3.2m x 2.4m.
