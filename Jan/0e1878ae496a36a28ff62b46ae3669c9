Since its launch in June 2020, What’s Next with Aki Anastasiou has exceeded 2.1 million video views and has featured interviews with top South African ICT executives like Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub, Dell SA MD Doug Woolley, and EOH CEO Stephen van Coller. It has also featured prominent South African businesspeople, including Montegray Capital’s Michael Jordaan and Sygnia CEO Magda Wierzycka.
