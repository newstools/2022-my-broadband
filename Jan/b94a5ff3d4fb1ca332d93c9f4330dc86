Most South Africans will now be accustomed to using alcohol-based hand sanitisers, often daily, to help curb the spread of Covid-19. In light of the pandemic, hand sanitising stations are everywhere to be found, including the entrances of malls, stores, offices, parks, and any spaces in which large numbers of people congregate. However, studies have found that many of the sanitisers used and sold in shops in South Africa do not meet the required criteria to neutralise the virus. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), an alcohol-based hand sanitiser must have 70% or more alcohol to be effective against Covid-19. The Centre for Disease Control in the US recommends a slightly lower proportion of at least 60%. A recent analysis of the alcohol content of 50 commercially available liquid and gel-based hand sanitisers used and sold in public spaces and shops revealed that less than half met the WHO’s criteria. The study was done by Professor Yusuf Abdullahi Ahmed of the University of Pretoria’s Department of Zoology and Entomology and was recently published in the South African Journal of Science. In the absence of appropriate quality control measures for hand sanitisers, Ahmed recommended that consumers use the WHO guide to prepare their own hand sanitisers as a better alternative to purchasing off-the-shelf products that are mostly sub-standard. The WHO provides a detailed guide and formula for manufacturing alcohol-based hand sanitiser for bulk local production. Its list of ingredients include: Most of the ingredients mentioned above can be bought from pharmacies or specialised online retailers. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-429366" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ethanol-.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ethanol-.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ethanol--600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ethanol--640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ethanol--768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> WHO’s recipe is primarily intended for cases where larger quantities might be needed. For a smaller batch for home use, Healthline spoke to Jagdish Khubdchandani, an associate professor of health sciences at Ball State University, for tips on making hand sanitiser. Based on his formulation, you can make hand sanitiser using these ingredients: To ensure your solution has a sufficient alcohol level, you must stick to a 2:1 proportion of alcohol to aloe vera. Once you have all your ingredients, Khubdchandani provided these steps to making the sanitiser: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-389736" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hand-sanitiser-headline.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hand-sanitiser-headline.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hand-sanitiser-headline-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hand-sanitiser-headline-640x426.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hand-sanitiser-headline-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Once you have made your hand sanitiser, you must apply it properly to be effective. Healthline advised the following to ensure the hand sanitiser can do what it is intended to: In any event, hand sanitisers might not work if your hands are visibly dirty or greasy, Healthline states. In addition, it is important to note that proper hand-washing is considered to be more effective than using hand sanitisers.
