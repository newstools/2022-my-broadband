Among the electric and electronic devices that now require certificates of compliance for electromagnetic compatibility in South Africa are toasters, irons, hotplates and grills. This is according to product guidelines the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) published on its website. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) issued a notice earlier this week for electronics and electrical appliance manufacturers. It stated that all electrical and electronic devices in South Africa that do not have radio frequency modules must have valid electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) certificates recognised by the SABS. According to iSERT, electromagnetic compatibility “is the branch of electrical engineering concerned with the unintentional generation, propagation and reception of electromagnetic energy which may cause unwanted effects such as electromagnetic interference or even physical damage in operational equipment.” Icasa’s notice came after both regulators were met with criticism when they tried to implement a new compliance regime in 2017. Among the concerns was that only compliance certificates from test laboratories authorised and integrated into the SABS Authorised Laboratory Programme (A-Lab) would be recognised. Icasa and the SABS have now changed their approach, recognising internationally accredited labs. A-Lab programme participants will receive faster service because the SABS has a streamlined process with affiliates, Icasa stated. According to product guidelines published by the SABS, all electrical components that emit noise must receive a conformance assessment. These include: Equipment included in the SABS EMC certificates of compliance product guidelines are: SABS EMC CoC Product Guidelines
