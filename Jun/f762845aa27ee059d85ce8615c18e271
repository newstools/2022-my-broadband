Axxess and Vuma Fibre are running a Double Up Promo for new and existing clients on the Vuma network until the end of September 2022. New sign-ups will get up to double their chosen line speed for a period of three months starting on the 13 June, while existing clients’ speeds will also be doubled. For example, if a client purchases a 50/50Mbps service during the promo period, it will still show as a 50/50Mbps service – but the line speed will be upgraded to 100/100Mbps until the end of September. This change in line speed will be implemented automatically and no changes will be made to clients’ invoices. The table below shows the new line speed upgrades as of the 13 June 2022. The upgrade process will be deployed in a phased approach – clients just need to make sure their hardware supports the new line speeds. All speed upgrades that are completed during the promotion period will qualify for the Double Up Promo. For example, if you upgrade your usual line speed from 50/50Mbps to 100/100Mbps, you will receive 200Mbps for the duration of the promo. Customers will be able to downgrade to a more suitable line speed via the client control panel should they feel they don’t require the extra speed – however, downgrades will revert to standard pricing during the 3-month promotional period. With 25 years of industry experience, Axxess offers a month-to-month service with no contracts, which includes 24/7 support services. Click here to check if Vuma Fibre is available in your area.
