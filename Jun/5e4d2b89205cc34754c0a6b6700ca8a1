South Africa has been plunged into stage 6 load-shedding from 16:00 on Tuesday, 28 June 2022, increasing the frequency and length of rotational power cuts. Eskom chief operating officer Jan Oberholzer said they did not decide to escalate load-shedding lightly, as stage 6 is a step-change from the lower stages of load-shedding. Stage 6 load-shedding doubles the frequency of Stage 3 power cuts, meaning power is cut to areas for 36 hours over four days — an average of nine hours each day. When the country is under stage 6 load-shedding, the rotational power cuts are implemented in bouts of two and four hours, with an additional 30 minutes to restore power. The “uptime” you get between bouts of load-shedding typically lasts between three-and-a-half and five-and-a-half hours at stage 6. MyBroadband considered what kind of battery backup system you would require to power some basic electrical equipment through four-and-a-half-hour load-shedding sessions. Our requirements were to power a Wi-Fi router, TV, DStv decoder or streaming stick, and a couple of LED lights. According to Energy Use Calculator, the average Wi-Fi router draws 6W. This works out to 27Wh over four-and-a-half hours. The average 55-inch TV draws less than 60W of electricity or 270Wh over four-and-a-half hours. LED lights are known for using less power than other light bulbs. We selected 5W-rated LED lights for our analysis. Over four-and-a-half hours, a 5W bulb will use 22.5Wh. Two bulbs will use 45Wh. The power consumption of DStv decoders varies depending on the model. A DStv Explora has a maximum power consumption of 45W, which means it will use 202.5Wh over four hours. Streaming sticks use less electricity, often using a standard 5W power brick. The average power usage of some basic electrical equipment is summarised then the table below. During stage 6 load-shedding, power can be cut for 4.5 hours at a time, with around 3.5 to 5.5 hours of “uptime” between bouts to recharge batteries. While uninterrupted power supplies (UPSes) are often sufficient to power a few pieces of equipment simultaneously during 2.5 outages, most can’t last through longer power cuts. It is also important to note that most UPSes — and many battery backup solutions — use lead-acid batteries that are not designed to discharge below 50%. The watt-hour capacity of a backup system should therefore be at least double that of the total consumption of the electrical equipment you want to run through load-shedding. Several battery backup systems that could power your electrical equipment through 4.5-hour bouts of load-shedding are listed below. Your needs will vary based on the power consumption of your equipment. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450524" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mecer-trolley-1V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mecer-trolley-1V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mecer-trolley-1V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mecer-trolley-1V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450526" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mecer-trolley-2V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mecer-trolley-2V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mecer-trolley-2V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mecer-trolley-2V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450528" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Solarwize-resizedV.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Solarwize-resizedV.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Solarwize-resizedV-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Solarwize-resizedV-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450530" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gentech-resizedV.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gentech-resizedV.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gentech-resizedV-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gentech-resizedV-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450532" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/KAPA-energie-1000V.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/KAPA-energie-1000V.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/KAPA-energie-1000V-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/KAPA-energie-1000V-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450538" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mobi-Volt.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mobi-Volt.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mobi-Volt-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mobi-Volt-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450536" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PowerOak-resizedV.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PowerOak-resizedV.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PowerOak-resizedV-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PowerOak-resizedV-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450534" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ecoflow-deltaV.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ecoflow-deltaV.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ecoflow-deltaV-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ecoflow-deltaV-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
