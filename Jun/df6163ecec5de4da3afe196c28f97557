The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 delivers great performance with the portability and flexibility of a tablet – making it ideal for your employees. It is designed so that your employees can work wherever they are, thanks to its multiple form factors that let them adapt to any environment, while providing superior performance to conventional laptops. We look at the advantages the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 offers to businesses, below. The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is designed to cater to your business’s needs, whether your staff are in the office, at home, or on the move. Its iconic kickstand ensures your employees can position the screen at any angle while working, which allows the Surface Pro 8 to be used as a laptop or a tablet – while its Slim Pen and touchscreen display provide a streamlined user experience. The Slim Pen is easy to use on the 13-inch, fast-refreshing 120Hz PixelSense Flow display that spreads almost edge-to-edge across the Surface Pro 8’s chassis. This provides an immersive experience that is easy on the eye. The design strikes a balance between being instantly familiar but also a genuine upgrade. Its magnesium alloy construction looks and feels as premium as ever with a matte finish that adds plenty of grip without any visible fingerprint smudges. The Surface Pro 8 is then powered by a battery that lasts for up to 16 hours, letting employees stay connected while on the go. When they do run low, fast charging tops the battery up in no time. Additionally, when your employees are connecting to external networks, you don’t need to worry about cyber threats as Microsoft Surface devices feature chip-to-cloud security into every layer – from hardware to firmware – to protect your business’s data. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-449762 size-full" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Microsoft-Image-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Microsoft-Image-1.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Microsoft-Image-1-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Microsoft-Image-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Complementing the Surface Pro 8’s flexibility is its impressive “business-laptop” performance levels.
