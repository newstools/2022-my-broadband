Sony has published the full library of PS4 and PS5 games that will be available on its new PlayStation Plus monthly gaming subscription service. The list includes over 400 games from PlayStation’s own studios and third-party developers. The revamped PlayStation Plus started rolling out on 24 May and launched in the US on Monday. It is scheduled to go live in South Africa on 23 June 2022. South African PS4 and PS5 owners will have three plans to choose from — Essential, Extra, and Deluxe. At R119 per month, the cheaper PlayStation Plus Essential will offer the same features as the current standard PlayStation Plus service. The Extra and Deluxe plans, priced at R179 and R209 per month, will offer the ability to download and play from a catalogue of hundreds of games, similar to Microsoft’s Game Pass service for Xbox and PC. Deluxe subscribers will also get access to a Classics Catalogue with original PlayStation and PS2 titles, and free limited-time game trials of major releases. PlayStation has promised a library consisting of over 700 games. The table below shows all of the PS4 and PS5 games available on PlayStation Plus Extra and Deluxe. The availability of titles with an asterisk might differ between regions.
