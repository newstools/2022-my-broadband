Samsung Electronics has launched its latest line of Odyssey gaming monitors, including a 32-inch 4K version with a 240Hz refresh rate — the G85NB. The curved monitor was the winner of the Best of Innovation in the gaming category at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2022. The G85NB — also known as the Odyssey Neo G8 — features AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and has a one millisecond response time. It uses Samsung’s Quantum Mini LED technology, which the company says ensures gamers see both light and dark scenes as they were intended. The Odyssey Neo G8 also features CoreSync lighting on the back of the monitor. The system automatically detects colours at the edges of the display and projects them behind the monitor, which Samsung says provides better immersion. Samsung’s 240Hz monitor uses a technology that the company calls Matte Display, reducing glare and reflection on the screen. The tech giant also announced two other monitors — the Odyssey Neo G7 (G75NB) and Odyssey Neo G4 (G40B). The latter also features a 240Hz refresh rate but tops out at a Full HD resolution. The specifications of all three monitors are provided in the table below.
