The International Data Corporation’s (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly PC Monitor Tracker showed almost no growth in the global PC monitor market compared to the same period last year. The IDC said the growth of 0.3% in shipping was still higher than expected after the tremendous volumes shipped in 2020 and 2021. “Although the result was higher than expected, the trend still conformed to expectations of a slowing market which began in the second half of 2021,” it said. It attributed the slight growth to an increased commercial uptake as consumer demand weakened. The IDC expects monitor shipments to decline in 2022 and 2023 before the market eventually stabilises in 2024. “The outlook for the rest of 2022 has been lowered compared to the previous forecast with global shipments expected to shrink 2.5% year over year in 2022,” it said. “IDC expects 2023 shipments will decline another 1.5% year on year before stabilising in 2024.” The IDC’s research manager for its Client Devices Tracker, Jay Chou, said that large portions of consumer demand were slowing amid economic challenges as countries continue to re-open. “However, we are largely reverting to the pre-pandemic trend of a market-driven largely by commercial replacements, many of which require multiple-monitor PC setups,” Chou added. Regarding individual brands, the IDC noted that Dell expanded its lead, with its share increasing from 18.7% in the first quarter of 2021 to 22.4% in 2022. At the same time, competition between other brands has been tight, with market shares ranging from 10.1% to 10.8% between Lenovo, HP, Samsung, and TPV.
