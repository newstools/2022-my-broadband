In October 2018, Naspers announced its Naspers Foundry initiative to boost the South African technology sector. Naspers Foundry’s mandate is to help South African technology entrepreneurs to develop and grow their businesses by using its R1.4 billion fund. Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk said the fund would encourage and back South African entrepreneurs to create businesses which ensure South Africa benefits from technology innovation. In July 2019, the global tech giant appointed Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa as Naspers South Africa CEO. Mahanyele-Dabengwa leads Naspers’ business in South Africa and is responsible for Naspers Foundry and Naspers Labs. Under her leadership, Naspers Foundry invested in numerous South African technology and finance businesses. To date, it has invested over R500 million in eleven businesses.
