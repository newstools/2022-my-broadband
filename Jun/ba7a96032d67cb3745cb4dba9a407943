Instant messaging platform Telegram has announced the launch of its subscription service, which the company said would let users support the app’s development and access additional features. iOS users in South Africa can subscribe to Telegram Premium for R89.99 per month. “[Telegram Premium] will allow us to offer all the resource-heavy features users have asked for over the years, while preserving free access to the most powerful messenger on the planet,” Telegram stated. Subscribers will unlock doubled group chat limits, 4 GB file uploads, faster downloads, exclusive stickers and reactions, and improved chat management. “Premium users get increased limits for almost everything in the app,” Telegram said. Telegram announced it would increase subscribers’ limits as follows: Premium users also can reserve up to 20 public t.me links. Telegram Premium subscribers can send 4 GB files. All users can download these extra-large documents. However, Telegram throttles non-subscribers’ download speeds. Regular Telegram users can still send files up to 2 GB. Telegram Premium subscribers will also receive access to several new features, including: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-449532" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Telegram-new-icons.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Telegram-new-icons.jpg 800w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Telegram-new-icons-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Telegram-new-icons-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> In addition to the premium features, Telegram announced several new features for all users on the platform. These include join requests for public groups, an animated screen for external sharing, improved bot descriptions, verification badges, and better chat previews on Android. “This update includes over 100 fixes and optimisations to the mobile and desktop apps — eliminating bugs, improving speed, and expanding minor features,” Telegram said. iOS users with the latest iPhones and iPads get significantly smoother animations (120 FPS) throughout the app. Android users received improved audio and video quality in voice and video messages. They also got options to set alternative app icons, clear all recent stickers at once, and translate user bios and chat descriptions. “Today is an important day in the history of Telegram — marking not only a new milestone, but also the beginning of Telegram’s sustainable monetisation,” Telegram said. “We believe that Telegram’s development should be driven primarily by its users, not advertisers. This way our users will always remain our main priority.” Telegram said the update is being rolled out gradually. “If your app is not offering you to update, please wait — the new version will become available soon.”
