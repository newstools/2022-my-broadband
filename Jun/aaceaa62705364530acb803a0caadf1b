The HONOR OS Turbo X ensures that the hardware and software work seamlessly together to improve fluency, anti-aging, and power consumption. Designed to optimize gaming performance, HONOR brings the industry first AI Super Rendering technology to mobile gaming through GPU Turbo X, delivering an exceptionally high framerate and network connectivity while generating less heat and lowering latency, adequately satisfying player’s demand for high gaming quality and buttery smooth graphics. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-446882 aligncenter" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-pro-_MEMC.png" alt="" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-pro-_MEMC.png 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-pro-_MEMC-400x400.png 400w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-pro-_MEMC-533x533.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This produces remarkable results in power consumption and performance, enhancing the overall gaming experience on the device.
