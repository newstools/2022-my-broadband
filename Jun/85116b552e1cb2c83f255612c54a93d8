When Sophos commissioned the ‘Seven Uncomfortable Truths’ survey, it highlighted that of all detected threats, one in 10 was found on a mobile device. “That shouldn’t be a surprise – right now, in fact, we probably all have a mobile device with us with access to email.” “The more reliant we are on a mobile device, the more we increase the risk of that device being the place where a threat first lands.” “The more emails you open, the higher the chance you might click on a phishing link, for example.” “This statistic highlights that we should be taking mobile device security seriously if we want to prevent and detect threats at the earliest possible opportunity,” says Ross Anderson, Sophos Product Development Manager at Duxbury Networking. Sophos Mobile is a secure Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solution that helps businesses spend less time and effort in managing and securing traditional and mobile endpoints. The only UEM solution that integrates natively with a leading next-gen endpoint security platform, Sophos Mobile supports management of Windows 10, macOS, iOS, and Android devices. “Sophos was rated a top performer in independent test organisation Miercom’s Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) Industry Assessment.” “Miercom conducted a study into leading mobile security solutions, measuring protection capabilities and cost of ownership. Sophos aced both categories, demonstrating superb protection against zero-day malware and advanced attacks,” says Anderson. Sophos Mobile allows users to secure any combination of personal and corporate-owned devices with minimal effort. When users bring their personal macOS, Windows 10, or mobile devices to work, the flexible self-service portal lets them enroll their device, reset passwords, and get help – with no involvement required from IT. Container-only management gives admins control over corporate content in the Sophos Secure Email and Sophos Secure Workspace apps without requiring management of the mobile device itself. “This is ideal in Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenarios, when you need business email and data to be protected and controlled without intruding on the users’ privacy,” says Anderson. Sophos Mobile includes several powerful, easy to use security tools: Managed seamlessly through Sophos Central, alongside Sophos’ entire portfolio of next-generation cybersecurity solutions, Sophos Mobile allows management of: – iOS, Android, Windows 10, macOS
– Configuration and policies
– Inventory and asset management
