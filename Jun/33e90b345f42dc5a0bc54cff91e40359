There is just one place where South African IT and telecoms companies can reach all of the country’s top ICT decision makers – MyBroadband. This is because MyBroadband is South Africa’s largest IT publication and attracted a readership of 2.5 million in April. What makes this readership unique is that the majority are IT decision makers – including CEOs, directors, business owners, and IT executives. This audience makes MyBroadband the safest place for IT and telecoms companies to advertise their businesses. MyBroadband Business offers a range of marketing products that are tailored to target this valuable audience. These products all perform exceptionally well and generate a much higher return on investment (ROI) than other marketing channels. The success of these campaigns has resulted in a large spike in marketing campaigns on MyBroadband this year. MyBroadband director Cara Muller said this increase in campaigns is understandable as companies prefer marketing channels which give them the highest ROI and excellent value for money.
