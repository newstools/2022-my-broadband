Huawei hosted the Eco-Connect South Africa 2022 in Johannesburg at the Sandton Convention Centre on July 8. ICT industry leaders, IT experts, and Huawei partners and customers gathered to share their insights and decipher global trends that are changing the ICT landscape. This year’s theme for Huawei Eco-Connect South Africa was Digitize, Transform the Present. Leading South African Information Technology company, Gijima, received two recognition awards at the event including IT Partner of the Year for a consecutive year and IT Service Partner of the Year. This achievement further cemented Gijima at the forefront of ICT innovation in South Africa. Gijima previously received the IT Partner of the Year award in 2021 and 2019 in recognition of its ability to jointly develop and make breakthroughs in key businesses with Huawei in the ICT Industry. Gijima chairman and founder, Robert Gumede, shared a testimony at the event. “Our digital transformation journey plans as Gijima have been made possible in light of working with a partner like Huawei. As the world changes, we are always one step ahead in finding innovative solutions to make a meaningful impact for our clients and South Africans.” The partnership between Gijima and Huawei started almost 20 years ago, collaborating on various public sector projects. Gijima was the first black-owned business to partner with the global tech giant. The collaboration has since evolved with Gijima partnering with Huawei to enhance ICT innovation in South Africa including cloud-based solutions. Sylvester Samuel, Managing Director, Gijima Cloud, Infrastructure and Security Solutions (GCISS) said, “Gijima is determined to unearth ICT innovation in South Africa and our partnership with Huawei is instrumental in helping us to achieve this objective. We want to build a long-lasting partnership with Huawei that will enable both parties to grow their market share in the SA ICT industry. Receiving recognition from Huawei reflects the solid collaboration between the two companies over the years.” Gijima has delivered significant value by leveraging Huawei storage and server technology in its multi-tenanted Gijima One Private Cloud, effectively delivering services to many clients. Gijima has also successfully implemented turnkey on-premises private cloud solutions, for several clients, leveraging the Huawei cloud technologies. Huawei’s network technologies have similarly connected many of Gijima’s clients and enabled WiFi6 connectivity for Gijima’s largest campus. Huawei Enterprise Partner and Alliance Development Director, Frenndy Wang said, “Gijima is Huawei’s strategic partner and we’ve grown together over the past years making a meaningful impact in South Africa’s ICT industry. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-455225" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/In-body.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/In-body.jpg 640w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/In-body-595x400.jpg 595w, https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/In-body-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> We are glad that Gijima received the IT and IT Service Partner of the Year, proving the growing partnership, and we’re looking forward to witnessing more business with Gijima which continues to add value for our South African customers.” As one of the top 100% black-owned ICT businesses in South Africa, Gijima prides itself in employing about 1600 people and bringing innovative cloud solutions, network services, cybersecurity, and ICT-managed services to South Africans.
