Home affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi has published an update to South Africa’s 2022 Critical Skills List, showing which skills are in high demand in South Africa. The list highlights the professions that qualify for South African critical skills work visas, making it an essential resource for local businesses. Such visas are only issued to individuals with skills or qualifications deemed critical for the country. The country is losing significant amounts of skilled professionals to emigration, making it increasingly necessary to attract people with specific skills to South Africa. During his 2022 State of the Nation address on 10 February 2022, President Cyril Ramaphosa provided an update on South Africa’s work visa system. He said the government had undertaken a comprehensive review of the work visa system led by former Home Affairs director-general Mavuso Msimang. “This review is exploring the possibility of new visa categories that could enable economic growth, such as a start-up visa and a remote working visa,” Ramaphosa added. The skills added to the updated list relate primarily to specialist medical and health professionals. However, it did include some additional tech qualifications, including electronic engineering technologist and engineering management skills. Most critical skills in the published list require a bachelor’s degree or advanced diploma as a minimum requirement, with only one requiring an intermediate certificate. A summary of the critical tech skills list is provided in the table below.
